65,65,A Kid's Best Friend,"{'Science', 'Animals'}","
Researchers recently studied the bond between kids and animals. They recruited 30 children and their dogs. 

 
The kids brought their dogs to a large, empty room. The kids walked around the space. Sometimes, they paused or changed direction. “The dog was left to do whatever the dog wanted to do—run around the room, or sniff, or lie down and take a nap,” Monique Udell says. She’s one of the study’s authors. 
 
Most of the time, a dog moved like its owner. When the kid walked, the dog walked too. When the kid stopped, the dog stopped. When the kid changed direction, so did the dog. 

What does this mean? Udell says it’s a dog’s way of building a relationship with a human. Adults are usually the ones who feed and care for pets. But “the kid may play a sibling role in the life of the dog,” Udell says. “Those bonds are important to the dog.”

Some of the world’s best athletes will be at the Summer Olympics, in Tokyo, Japan. There are four sports new to the Games. Learn about them. Then meet some members of Team U.S.A.
Sport Climbing
Colin Duffy is 17 years old. He’s been climbing since he was 5. In July, Colin will take a big trip. He’ll go to Tokyo, Japan. He’s on Team U.S.A.’s first Olympic sport-climbing team.
“I feel super excited,” Colin told TIME for Kids. “It means so much to me.” 
At the Olympics, climbers will be competing in three styles. These are speed, lead, and bouldering. In the speed contest, two climbers will race up a wall. In lead, a climber has six minutes to go as high as possible. In bouldering, climbers follow fixed routes.

TFK Kid Reporter Jeremy Liew spoke to another climber. Her name is Kyra Condie. She is from Shoreview, Minnesota. Climbing is a “mental and physical” sport, she says. “You have to be problem-solving as you’re competing.”

Like Colin, Condie started training at a young age. So did Nathaniel Coleman. He’s from Utah. Brooke Raboutou did too. She’s from Colorado. They’re also part of Team U.S.A. 
The COVID-19 pandemic delayed the Summer Olympics. The athletes had to find new ways to train. Colin says he was lucky. “I was able to climb outside,” he says. “I also have a climbing wall in my basement.”

Athletes will be competing for Olympic medals. But Colin isn’t putting pressure on himself to win them. He’s focused on something else. He wants to enjoy his time in Tokyo. He’s looking forward to meeting athletes from all around the world. It’ll be “life-changing,” he says. “I want to remember it forever.”
Surfing

Surf’s up! For the first time, there will be surfing at the Olympics. Surfers won’t just be competing against one another. They’ll also be competing against the ocean. Part of a surfer’s score will depend on the wave he or she rides. The tougher the wave, the higher the score can be. 
Surfers have 30 minutes. Only their two highest-scoring waves count. So you can expect to see athletes waiting for the perfect moment to make their move. 

Skateboarding

At the Olympics, skateboarders compete on two courses. Park-style events take place in a big concrete bowl. Boarders perform tricks. In street-style events, they face stairs, rails, benches, and more.

Karate

Eighty athletes will take part in the first Olympic karate competition. There are three fighting categories. There is also one kata category. In kata, athletes perform karate moves for the judges. They must be precise in their movements.

Watch the Tokyo Olympics with all the Team U.S.A. athletes starting July 23 on NBC.

2,2,A Cleaner Meat,"{'Science', 'Food and Nutrition'}","
Mosa Meat is a company in the Netherlands. Its scientists grow meat in a lab. It looks just like the meat you buy in a supermarket.
Why are people making lab-grown meat? It might be better for the environment. Most meat comes from animals raised on factory farms. The animals are crowded into a small space. They eat, they burp, and they poop. A lot of gas is produced. This gas is one cause of global warming.
Johanna Melke is a  at Mosa. She says growing meat in a lab is a better way to produce it. “People want to eat meat,” she says. “This is how we solve the problem.”

Beef, and More
Here’s how the meat is made. A veterinarian takes a tiny piece of muscle from a cow. It doesn’t hurt much. The muscle is taken to a lab. It’s put into a special broth. This helps the muscle grow. From this, something like hamburger meat is made.

Mosa is not the only company doing this. There are more than 70 of them. And they make more than just beef. They can grow meat from a chicken, a tuna—even a mouse. That’s used to make cat treats. 

An Easier Choice
Mark Post helped found Mosa Meat. He says people are aware that factory farming can be harmful. But it’s hard for them to give up meat. “I wanted to make the choice for those people easier,” he says.
So how does lab-grown meat taste? Laura Jackisch is a scientist at Mosa. She gave up meat years ago. Then she tasted Mosa’s lab-grown beef. “I started  steak again,” she says.

Tastes Fishy
Avant Meats makes fish meat in a lab. This includes fish maw. This part of the fish is popular in China. Lab-grown maw feels like real fish before it’s cooked. That’s what chef Eddy Leung thinks. “But when you eat it, it doesn’t yet have the kind of stickiness the real ones do.” —By Amy Gunia for TIME, adapted by TFK editors

On March 14, 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic forced 57th Street Books to close. The store is in Chicago, Illinois. It didn’t reopen for nearly a year and a half. Director Jeff Deutsch was worried. Customers couldn’t come in and browse the shelves. 
Deutsch says he was lucky. People stepped up. They gave gifts. They offered support. “Our community came together during the pandemic,” he told TIME for Kids.
In the past two years, the same has been true for bookstores all over the country. They were forced to close during the pandemic, but many found ways to connect with customers and help their communities.  
New Ideas
Before the pandemic, bookstores were already struggling. Many had a hard time competing with Internet retailers, such as Amazon. Then came COVID-19. In 2020, one in five  bookstores in the United States was in danger of closing. That’s according to the American Booksellers Association (ABA). 

But many stores were able to recover with new ideas. The King’s English Bookshop is in Salt Lake City, Utah. The staff put books outside for customers to see. The shop also hosted online events for kids. Other stores set up bookselling . Some sold books out of vans.

“Special and Fun”
One fan of 57th Street Books is Adele Sorkin. She’s 11. She’s on the store’s Young Readers Advisory Board. Members receive and review new books. “I think of the bookstore as a cookie jar,” Adele says. “It’s something special and fun that is always there for you.”

Gray wolves are going back on the endangered-species list. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) creates this list. It took the gray wolf off in early 2021. But on February 10, 2022, a judge made a ruling. He decided the animals still need protection.  
Jeffrey S. White was the judge in the case. He ruled that the USFWS had failed to analyze the decision carefully. It didn’t think about the impact of delisting gray wolves. The judge’s decision affects most of the continental U.S.  
Kitty Block is with the Humane Society of the U.S. She is the group’s president. Block calls the ruling a victory. She says the USFWS “must develop a plan” to help gray wolves.

Disney-Pixar’s new movie is called Turning Red. It’s about a girl named Meilin Lee. She’s Chinese-Canadian.
Meilin is having a tough time growing up. It doesn’t help that she turns into a giant red panda when she gets too excited. 
Actor Rosalie Chiang is the voice of Mei. She says turning into a red panda is how Mei shows her fears about growing up. “Red Panda is just Mei times 100,” Rosalie says. 
Asian people in films are often shown being successful. Sometimes, they are superheroes. Rosalie says this puts pressure on Asian viewers. They might feel they have to live up to high expectations.
Mei is a different kind of character. She’s not perfect, Rosalie says. That gives viewers a new way of understanding Asian family life. 
Rosalie says there is a message to take away from Mei’s story. “Differences are what make people who they are,” she says. “Find out who you are. Not what other people want you to be.”

Aadya Joshi looks out at eucalyptus trees. They were planted to replace a forest. Eucalyptus trees don’t grow naturally here in India.  trees should have been planted, she says. 
Joshi started The Right Green. 
It teaches people about biodiversity and growing native trees (see “Biodiversity”). Planting new trees “sounds like a good idea,” she says. “But what [people are] doing in many places is not  forests. They’re just replanting.” There’s a difference.

Replanting Problems
Trees are important to the health of the planet. They help clean the air. But many trees have been cut down.  
Some efforts to replant trees make things worse. This happened in Chile, in South America. Big companies cut down forests for timber. Then they replanted trees. But they used the wrong kinds and created tree plantations. “They’re not really what we imagine a forest to be,” Robert Heilmayr says. “These trees are more like a crop.” 
Heilmayr is a professor. He says tree  are not as good as forests are at cleaning the air. 


Restoration Done Right
Restoring native forests should  people. That’s according to Bernadette Arakwiye of the World Resources Institute (WRI) Forest Program, in Africa. “People are a part of the environment,” she says. One WRI program will restore thousands of miles of forest by 2030.
Joshi says planting native trees fights climate change. People are working together to do the job right.


Biodiversity
Biodiversity is the variety of living things in a habitat. An environment needs diversity. Diversity maintains balance. For example, insects carry pollen from plant to plant. Plants need it to make seeds. The seeds grow into plants. Plants provide food for insects. Insects become food for frogs. You can help protect biodiversity. Learn about the plants and animals in your area. Join efforts to plant native trees.

What kinds of trees are near you? There are about 1,000 different tree species in the United States. These are four of the most common. They are native to the U.S.

The white oak is large and strong. It can live for 300 years. Its acorns are an important food source for turkeys, woodpeckers, and rabbits. Deer eat some parts of these trees, too.

The red maple is a very common tree in eastern North America. Its leaves turn red in the fall. Squirrels eat its seeds. Deer and rabbits eat its leaves and shoots.

The sugar maple is known for its fall colors. It’s also known for its sap, which is used to make syrup. White-tailed deer eat its twigs and leaves. Porcupines eat its bark.

The Douglas fir is a popular kind of Christmas tree. It’s evergreen, so it doesn’t lose its needles. Birds, squirrels, and rabbits eat its seeds. It provides shelter for many animals.

Massimo Bottura is a chef. He opened a restaurant 27 years ago in Italy. It has twice been named best in the world. 
But Bottura says his greatest accomplishment is Refettorio Ambrosiano. Its menu changes daily. It all depends on what comes in the morning delivery. One day, the delivery brings chicken. It is close to its sell-by date. There are oranges too ugly for the grocery store. By dinner, the ingredients have been turned into something delicious. 

Bottura has 13 Refettorios around the world. They are not restaurants. They are soup kitchens. But Bottura wouldn’t call them that. He thinks of them as places that respect the  of their guests. These guests include refugees, the homeless, and the unemployed. For an hour, they can forget about life’s challenges. 

Making a Difference
Bottura’s Refettorios bring attention to the problem of food waste. Chefs make full meals out of  food. They squeeze the most out of every ingredient, from vegetable peelings to stale bread.  

Turning basic ingredients into amazing meals is Bottura’s magic. His grandmother taught him how to do this. “What you think is food waste is an opportunity to create something amazing,” he says.

Chefs at Bottura’s restaurants learn his approach to cooking. They also learn that he wants to make a difference. “Everybody has the ability to contribute to positive change,” he says. “It starts with all of us, in our own kitchens.”
Creating a Movement

Bottura came up with the idea of Refettorio Ambrosiano in 2015. He was asked to cook for the grand opening of a big event. Bottura suggested something different. He wanted to cook for the homeless. He invited the world’s best chefs to help. Today, the Refettorio is “a movement,” Bottura says.

Rob Knight is a scientist. He works at the University of California San Diego. He studies wastewater. That’s the water that has been flushed down the toilet.

Knight is testing the school’s . He’s looking for the virus that causes COVID-19. It can be found in people’s pee and poop. Knight uses a robot. It collects wastewater from a school building’s pipes. Sometimes, the robot finds the virus. When this happens, Knight warns people to stay away from the building. Then his team tests people for COVID-19. Everyone who uses the building is tested. Anyone who is infected is kept out.

The system works. It helped COVID-19 cases at the university go down. In January 2021, eight out of every 10 wastewater samples had the virus. By that spring, fewer than one out of 10 samples had the virus. It “ our wildest dreams,” Knight says.

Speedy Results
A similar system is working for larger communities too. Cities and states are collecting wastewater. Their wastewater information is added to an online database. Scientists study the data. This helps officials understand how the virus spreads.

The database is run by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Amy Kirby is a scientist there. She says the database could help fight diseases in the future. The next dangerous virus could be managed more quickly, she says. That’s thanks to our pee and poop.

Jane Goodall was a stubborn kid. She didn’t always do what she was told. But her stubbornness led her to success. She became the world’s best-known primatologist.

In 1960, Goodall sat for months in the forests of Tanzania, in Africa. The chimpanzees there accepted her. She discovered that they use tools.
In 1962, professors said Goodall shouldn’t use human names and emotions to describe chimps. “I just quietly went on doing what I knew was right,” she says. Many experts today agree with her methods.

In 1986, Goodall began charity and activism work. It’s been more than 35 years. She’s still on the job.
Telling Her Story
Goodall shares her life story to make people care about the environment. “You’ve got to reach the heart,” she says. “I do that through storytelling.”

Before the COVID-19 pandemic, Goodall traveled 300 days a year. She spoke to school assemblies and at conferences. Now she does virtual lectures and interviews. Her stories leave audiences feeling hopeful.
Inspiring Others
Many people call Goodall an inspiration. Vanessa Nakate is a climate activist. She says Goodall taught her “that protecting our ecosystems is so important.”

David Attenborough makes films about nature. He spoke to TIME about Goodall in 2019. “She’s an amazing woman,” he said.
Roots & Shoots
Goodall started a youth-activism program in 1991. It’s called Roots & Shoots. Today, it has groups in more than 60 countries. At least 100,000 kids and teens are running more than 5,800 community projects. They support people, animals, and the planet.

Larger oil spills are a hazard for people and wildlife. Spilled oil must be removed from the environment. Emergency response teams are called in to do the work. There are several ways to clean up oil spills. This diagram explains four of them. 
1. Shoreline Flushing 
Hoses rinse oil from the shore. The oil is washed into the water. It’s more easily collected there.
2. Booms 
Booms are floating barriers. They are used to stop oil from spreading on the water’s surface.
3. Sorbents 
Sorbents act like sponges. They absorb oil but do not pick up water.
4. Burning 
Newly spilled oil can be set on fire. This helps remove the oil that is floating on the water.

In October, an underwater pipe leaked. Oil poured into the Pacific Ocean. This happened near Huntington Beach, California. Oil covered the water for miles. Some of it washed up onshore. Beaches were closed. Unfortunately, oil spills are not uncommon. When they happen, they can cause a lot of damage. 


 
How Oil Spills Happen 
Oil is a fossil fuel. It’s used in gasoline. That powers boats, cars, and trucks. It’s also used to make things. Some plastics, paints, and makeups are made with oil.
Oil can be found below the ocean floor. Machines drill beneath the ocean. Then the oil is pumped out. This is called extraction. It’s one way oil can accidentally leak. Oil spills can also be caused by transporting, or moving, oil. (See “Where Do Oil Spills Come From?”)



Impacting the Environment
In the United States, thousands of oil spills happen each year. It can take years to clean up after a large spill. But even small leaks and spills can cause damage. 
Oil spills can have long-lasting effects. They hurt wildlife. Birds get oil on their feathers. They can’t fly. Sea otters get oil in their fur. This makes it hard for them to stay warm. Oil creates toxic fumes. This makes it hard for whales to breathe.  
 

Kim Carr is on the Huntington Beach city council. Her community was affected by the oil spill. After it happened, she said, “We are doing everything in our power to protect the health and safety of our residents, our visitors, and our natural habitats.”

More than 33 million people were watching on television. Gorman had been chosen to deliver a poem at the inauguration of President Joe Biden. She was 22. Gorman is the youngest poet in U.S. history to read at a presidential inauguration. She read a poem called “The Hill We Climb.” It’s about diversity and hope. 

 
A Way with Words 
Gorman started writing poetry in grade school. “When other kids were playing, I was always scribbling away in my notebook,” she told TIME for Kids. As a child, Gorman had a speech impediment. She had trouble saying some words. Poetry helped. “It allowed me to express myself,” she says. Gorman practiced reading her poems aloud. This improved her speech. “It gave me a tool to help overcome my disability and turned it into one of my greatest strengths.” 

In 2017, Gorman became the first National Youth Poet Laureate of the United States. In this role, she helped spread the joy and power of poetry to others. 
Gorman hopes more young people take up poetry. Her advice for young poets? Read. Have patience while waiting for inspiration to come. “Poetry is for everyone,” she says. “So embrace what makes your voice unique!” 

Making Change

Amanda Gorman has written a picture book. It’s called Change Sings. It’s a poem about how kids can change the world with small actions. They can do things like pick up litter.

What’s it like to see Earth from space? “It takes my breath away,” astronaut Christina Koch says. “The blues are very bright. And it glows.”
In February 2020, Koch completed a  on the International Space Station (ISS). It was the second-longest stay in space by an American astronaut. It was the longest by a female astronaut: 328 days. Here’s how Koch spent them.

Daily Rounds 
Koch’s job on the ISS was to do science experiments. The work could be challenging. There’s less  in space. Tools have a way of drifting out of reach. “There’s no putting things down,” she says. “Everything just floats around.”
Koch’s experiments will help us prepare for future space missions. For instance, she studied how vegetables grow in space. She also studied how spaceflight affects the human body. She tested robots and studied how fire behaves in space.

Astronauts work long days on the ISS. And they spend two hours a day on exercise machines. This keeps their muscles strong.
Then it’s time to wind down. Koch ate dinner with crewmates. Meals were packaged and had to be heated up. But there was variety: Asian stir-fries, lasagna, and pizza.

Bedrooms on the ISS are just big enough for a sleeping bag. Each night, Koch zipped herself in and floated off to sleep. “That was the moment of release,” she says. “I could finally relax.” 

A Historic Moment
On October 18, 2019, Koch (right) and her crewmate, Jessica Meir, did the first all-female spacewalk. This is when astronauts make  on the outside of the ISS. 
During her mission in space, Koch completed six spacewalks. “Imagine being outside the space station, looking at the Earth,” she says. “It’s just incredible.”

“We do the best we can,” Jane Waterman says. She’s a co-owner of Uptown Christmas Trees. The business sells trees in New York City. Most of them are grown in Vermont.

Waterman and her family run the business. They have done this for more than 45 years. She says it’s hard to make seasonal income last. “We are scraping by more at the end of the year than at the beginning,” she says. “You think you have a lot of money when you’re working. But you actually don’t.” So what does she do?
Building a Budget
Waterman makes a budget. A budget is a plan for spending and saving money. You plan to pay for what you need, plus a few things you want. And you plan to save.

To make a budget, Waterman uses math. She starts with the total amount of money she earns. She divides that amount by 12, the number of months in a year. From that number she subtracts her monthly . Whatever is left over, she saves (see “Backup Plan”).
Would you like to create a budget for yourself? It’s never too soon to try!
Backup Plan
Seasonal workers need a backup plan. A tree seller can have a bad season. This might be due to bad weather. Or there could be a tree shortage.
So Waterman has an emergency . Many seasonal workers do. They put some of their savings into it. This fund can help them get through tough times.

Biles spent years getting ready for the 2020 Olympics, in Tokyo, Japan. They took place last summer. They were delayed a year because of the pandemic. But on July 27, Biles unexpectedly stepped back from her team. She did this to focus on her mental health and  safety.

Biles had the “twisties.” That made it difficult for her to do turns in the air. She was afraid she would get hurt. Biles had to look out for her . “I just need to let [my teammates] do it and focus on myself,” she said. 
Taking a Stand
Biles isn’t the first athlete to speak out. Others have raised the issue of pressure in competitive sports. Naomi Osaka is a well-known tennis player. In May, she  from the French Open. That’s a big tennis competition. She was concerned about her mental health.  
Michael Phelps is a famous swimmer. He has long spoken out about his struggles. “We’re human beings,” he says. “It is okay to not be okay.”

Athletes are usually taught to focus on winning. They work through pain. They keep on competing through injury. But now, sports stars are pushing back. They say that winning shouldn’t be more important than their health. 
“It’s okay sometimes to even sit out the big competitions,” Biles said. 
Jill Emanuele works at the Child Mind Institute. The organization is in New York City. It focuses on children’s mental health. Emanuele has advice for young athletes. “[Talk] to people when you have trouble,” she says.

Los lobos grises han vivido en América del Norte por lo menos por medio millón de años. En un momento había muchísimos lobos aquí. Pero para los años 60, la población de lobos en Estados Unidos cayó estrepitosamente. Solo quedó un número pequeño.

En 1973, la propuesta de ley de Especies en Peligro de Extinción se hizo ley. Esta protege a los animales que podrían extinguirse. Los lobos grises se colocaron en la lista de especies en peligro de extinción. Matarlos era ilegal. Esta ley fue un éxito. Hoy, hay más de 6,000 lobos grises en EE.UU. continental. En enero de 2021, el gobierno de EE.UU. retiró a los lobos de la lista de especies en peligro de extinción. Pero algunos conservacionistas no están de acuerdo con esta decisión. Dicen que los lobos aún necesitan protección. 

Salvar a los lobos
En partes del país, los lobos están bien. Algunos dicen que el lobo ya no pertenece a la lista de especies en peligro de extinción. 

Pero los lobos grises solían vivir en la mayoría de EE.UU. Ahora solo se encuentran en menos de 12 estados. Algunas personas piensan que esto significa que la especie aún corre peligro. “Aún hay muchos lugares donde la población no ha regresado”, dice Jason Rylander. Él es un conservacionista.

Los grupos medioambientales están haciendo juicio al gobierno de EE.UU. por remover las protecciones del lobo. Por ahora, la protección de la mayoría de los lobos depende de cada estado. En noviembre de 2020, la gente de Colorado votó para proteger a los lobos dentro de los límites del estado. 

Datos de los lobos grises
El lobo gris tiene dientes largos y mandíbulas fuertes. Los lobos machos pesan alrededor de 100 libras. Miden más de seis pies de largo. (Esto incluye la cola espesa de un lobo. Tiene de uno a dos pies de largo). Los lobos viven en jaurías o grupos. Ellos se comunican usando sus cuerpos y colas. También aúllan. Aullar ayuda a los miembros de la jauría a mantenerse en contacto.

Gray wolves have lived in North America for at least half a million years. There were once many wolves here. But by the 1960s, the United States wolf population had crashed. Only a small number were left.

In 1973, the Endangered Species Act became law. It protects animals that could become extinct. Gray wolves were put on the endangered-species list. Killing them was illegal.
This law was a success. Today, there are more than 6,000 gray wolves in the  U.S.

In January 2021, the U.S. government removed wolves from the endangered-species list. But some  disagree with the decision. They say wolves still need protection.
Saving the Wolves
In parts of the country, wolves are doing well. Some say that means the wolf does not belong on the endangered-species list. But gray wolves used to live across most of the U.S. Now they are found in fewer than 12 states.

Some people think that means the species is still at risk. “There are still too many places where the population hasn’t come back,” says Jason Rylander. He is a conservationist.
Environmental groups are  the U.S. government for removing wolf protections. For now, it is up to each state to protect most of its wolves. In November 2020, people in Colorado voted to protect wolves inside the state’s borders.

Gray Wolf Facts
The gray wolf has long teeth. It has strong jaws. Male wolves weigh about 100 pounds. They are more than six feet long. (That includes a wolf’s bushy tail. It is one or two feet long.) Wolves live in packs, or groups. They communicate using their bodies and tails. They also howl. Howling helps pack members stay in touch.

The Endangered Species Act (ESA) became a United States law in 1973. When a type of animal is at risk, it can be added to the endangered-species list. The government works to save these animals. A species is taken off the list when it is no longer at risk. These four animals are ESA success stories. 

The BALD EAGLE is the national bird of the U.S. This bird can soar 10,000 feet high. It has excellent eyesight. This helps it hunt for fish and other small animals. To attack prey, it can dive at speeds of 100 miles per hour. 
The BLACK-FOOTED FERRET is a small predator. The species was once thought to be extinct. But in 1981, a group of them was discovered in Wyoming. With protection, the ferrets multiplied. There are now a few hundred of them in the U.S. 
The AMERICAN ALLIGATOR is a reptile. It is made for life in the water. An alligator has webbed feet. It uses its strong tail to swim. A male weighs about 500 pounds. But large alligators have weighed in at 1,000 pounds.

A Cleaner Way
Electric cars use batteries. These batteries are like the ones in smartphones. They can be recharged. And the material inside can be recycled.
Electric cars are not perfect. They are recharged with energy from power plants. These plants burn . But countries can switch to cleaner energy sources. These include wind and solar power. That means electric vehicles can get cleaner too.

Not many people own an electric car. Two things need to happen first. More charging stations need to be built. They must be widely available. And electric cars must cost less. Last year, 67 million new cars were sold. Only about 3 million were electric. 
But this is just the beginning. Viswanathan thinks we will one day have more solar-powered homes. We may even have electric cars that fly. “Your entire life will run on batteries,” he says. “It will be a totally new world.”

On the Rise
Sales of electric vehicles (EVs) are going up. Look at the chart. It shows cars sold through 2030. By then, half could be electric.

Colin Duffy is 17 years old. He’s been climbing since he was 5. In July, Colin will take a big trip. He’ll go to Tokyo, Japan. He’s on Team U.S.A.’s first Olympic sport-climbing team.
“I feel super excited,” Colin told TIME for Kids. “It means so much to me.” 
At the Olympics, climbers will be competing in three styles. These are speed, lead, and bouldering. In the speed contest, two climbers will race up a wall. In lead, a climber has six minutes to go as high as possible. In bouldering, climbers follow fixed routes.

TFK Kid Reporter Jeremy Liew spoke to another climber. Her name is Kyra Condie. She is from Shoreview, Minnesota. Climbing is a “mental and physical” sport, she says. “You have to be problem-solving as you’re competing.”

Like Colin, Condie started training at a young age. So did Nathaniel Coleman. He’s from Utah. Brooke Raboutou did too. She’s from Colorado. They’re also part of Team U.S.A. 
The COVID-19 pandemic delayed the Summer Olympics. The athletes had to find new ways to train. Colin says he was lucky. “I was able to climb outside,” he says. “I also have a climbing wall in my basement.”

Athletes will be competing for Olympic medals. But Colin isn’t putting pressure on himself to win them. He’s focused on something else. He wants to enjoy his time in Tokyo. He’s looking forward to meeting athletes from all around the world. It’ll be “life-changing,” he says. “I want to remember it forever.”
Surfing

Surf’s up! For the first time, there will be surfing at the Olympics. Surfers won’t just be competing against one another. They’ll also be competing against the ocean. Part of a surfer’s score will depend on the wave he or she rides. The tougher the wave, the higher the score can be. 
Surfers have 30 minutes. Only their two highest-scoring waves count. So you can expect to see athletes waiting for the perfect moment to make their move. 

Skateboarding

At the Olympics, skateboarders compete on two courses. Park-style events take place in a big concrete bowl. Boarders perform tricks. In street-style events, they face stairs, rails, benches, and more.

Karate

Eighty athletes will take part in the first Olympic karate competition. There are three fighting categories. There is also one kata category. In kata, athletes perform karate moves for the judges. They must be precise in their movements.

Watch the Tokyo Olympics with all the Team U.S.A. athletes starting July 23 on NBC.

A  event is taking place this spring. Trillions of Brood 10 cicadas have just spent 17 years underground. But in May, they will . They will create a buzz as loud as a lawn mower. And by June or July, they will be gone. Their  will do the same thing in another 17 years. 
Cicadas come out to mate. The buzz you hear is their mating call. It’s the males that make all the noise. Michael Raupp studies insects at the University of Maryland, College Park. He says there will be plenty of drama. “There’s going to be birth. There’s going to be death. There’s going to be . There’s going to be romance. There are going to be songs,” he told TIME for Kids. 

The cicadas will emerge when soil temperatures reach 64°F. The insects crawl out of the ground and fly up into the trees. If you’re standing outside, one might climb up your arm. But cicadas aren’t dangerous—they don’t bite or sting. “This unique event happens nowhere else on the planet,” Raupp says. “Just go out and enjoy these things.”

In February, NASA’s rover landed on Mars. Its name is Perseverance. Its job is to find signs of past life.
Tiny life-forms called microbes might have lived on Mars. That would have been more than 3 billion years ago. The planet was warm then. Water flowed into a lake. Now the lake is dried up. The planet is cold. But fossils of microbes might be found in rocks.
Perseverance uses lasers and drills to search for fossils. And it has a helper. A helicopter named Ingenuity could fly above the old lake. It will show NASA whether flying machines can be used on future missions.

89,89,Congress at Work,"{'United States', 'Government'}","
The United States government has three branches. Congress is the legislative branch. It makes the nation’s laws. Congress works in the U.S. Capitol building. That’s in Washington, D.C. 
Congress has two , or parts. One is the Senate. The other is the House of Representatives. The Senate has 100 senators. That’s two for each state. Senators are elected every six years.

The House has 435 members. They serve two-year . The number of representatives from each state depends on its population. States with more people get more .

Laws of the Land
 
To make a law, Congress starts with a bill. Any member of Congress can write one. It’s even possible for your ideas to become a bill. You can send them to your representative or Senator in a letter or email.

After a bill is written, the House and the Senate debate it. The bill must get a majority of votes in both chambers to pass. Then the bill goes to the president. If the president signs the bill, it becomes a law. 
Congress also acts as a check on the president’s power. Let’s say the president vetoes, or rejects, a bill. Congress can  the veto if two-thirds of its members vote to do so.
Congress shares power with the executive branch. That branch is led by the president. It also shares power with the judicial branch. The U.S. Supreme Court is that branch’s highest court.
Leading the House

The House of Representatives is led by one of its members. This person is called the Speaker of the House. The current Speaker is Nancy Pelosi. She’s a representative from California. She’s the first woman to hold this position.
The Speaker is elected by House members every two years. He or she is second in line to take over the president’s job, if necessary. The vice president is first.

91,91,Ask the Author,"{'Arts', 'Books'}","
Jon Klassen is an author and illustrator. He’s written four books for kids. They have been published in many languages. TIME for Kids asked Klassen five questions about his work. 

 
Did you always like to write and draw?

 
In the second or third grade, I started writing stories. And I drew pictures to go with them. I still sort of work that way. I don’t have a huge interest in making pictures if there’s not a story. 
What’s your process for creating a new story?
I don’t start with an ending in mind, or even a whole story. I start with the setup. Hopefully, that setup gives birth to some characters. The characters have to feel natural. If I feel like I’m forcing them to do what they’re doing, the book won’t work, even if the setup is funny. 
How do you know a story is finished?

 
I  with it until it feels like it has ended. I like to try to change the idea of what an ending feels like. It might not be a  ending. But it will still cause something to click in your head, so you say, “That’s done.” 
How do you make pictures?

 
I do a lot of tests. I might paint 12 big rocks on a page. I’ll circle my favorite four rocks. Then I scan them. On my computer, I assemble those rocks with all my other pieces. I try to make the page feel . 
What is your favorite part of writing books for kids?

Kids are careful readers, and they focus hard on what they read. I can count on kids to pick up on details. It’s an .
Out Now

The Rock from the Sky is Jon Klassen’s newest book. It contains five stories about three animals. It’s also about friendship, jealousy, and the future. Like all of Klassen’s books, this one begins with a problem: There’s a giant rock falling from the sky. And it’s heading straight for the turtle. What will happen next?

Fortunately
Fortunately, Ned has been invited to a surprise party. Unfortunately, the party is many miles away. Fortunately, by Remy Charlip, follows Ned’s journey to the party. It’s an adventure filled with mishaps. Klassen loves the book’s simple illustrations. “It’s also just really funny,” he says. 
Sylvester and the Magic Pebble
Sylvester collects pebbles. One day, he finds one that grants wishes. But Sylvester’s wish causes big problems. It takes a long time for them to be solved. Klassen says Sylvester and the Magic Pebble, by William Steig, packs a lot into a short space: “It’s amazing, all that happens.”
Sam and the Firefly
Sam and the Firefly, by P.D. Eastman, was Klassen’s first favorite book. It’s about an owl named Sam. He’s awake at night, looking for a playmate. Klassen likes the story. But what he loves are the pictures. They make readers feel like they are inside another world. “I love the way that feels,” he says.

100,100,The PPE Problem,"{'World', 'Environment'}","
Zoë Trisha Prinsloo cares about the beaches of Cape Town, South Africa. She leads cleanups there. She has a group called Save a Fishie! It has picked up plastic bottles, straws, and more. 

Lately, Prinsloo has noticed more of one kind of waste: PPE. That stands for “personal protective equipment.” Face masks and gloves are two types of PPE. At a cleanup last year, Prinsloo saw eight different kinds of gloves. “I find masks more and more regularly too,” she told TIME for Kids. 

Lots of people wear PPE. It helps protect against COVID-19. But when PPE isn’t thrown out the right way, it  the environment. It harms wildlife. This is a growing problem. Many people want to fix it.
A Pollution Solution

At least 8 million tons of plastic enter oceans each year. That’s according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature. In September 2020, the Ocean  held an International Coastal Cleanup. Tens of thousands of PPE items were found. George Leonard is the group’s chief scientist. He spoke to CNN. “PPE waste is a  threat to oceans,” he said.

PPE waste can hurt ocean animals. They can eat it or get tangled in it. Other wildlife is at risk too. Sue Schwar manages South Essex Wildlife Hospital. It’s in the United Kingdom. Her team rescued a seagull. “The loops of a face mask were bound around its legs,” she says. Thankfully, the staff was able to untangle the bird. It healed. They set it free and watched it fly away. 
How To Help

You can help solve the PPE problem. Wear clean reusable masks. Snip the straps before throwing any mask away. This will protect animals. They won’t get tangled up. Put used PPE in a garbage can with a secure lid. This is important when the can is outside. Masks and gloves can be carried away by the wind.

101,101,Can We Compost It?,"{'Earth Science', 'Environment'}","
Some of your trash can be used to help the planet. With composting, you can recycle food and other organic materials. It can be turned into fertilizer to help plants grow. Composting is good for the planet. It reduces the amount of waste we make. With composting, less waste ends up in landfills. 
To compost, you will first need a compost bin. Add soil to it. Then add leaves and twigs. Next, add some water. Now old scraps of food can be mixed in. Fruits and vegetables can be composted. So can old tea bags, eggshells, coffee grounds, and more.
The soil contains tiny creatures. They feed on the scraps you compost. They break them down. This makes the soil rich with nutrients. 
The chart below shows items that can and cannot be composted. Try composting at home or school. Then use your nutrient-rich soil to plant a garden.

The 2020 Atlantic hurricane season was the most active on record. Between May and November, 30 major storms  in the Atlantic Ocean. Thirteen of them became hurricanes.
Eta and Iota were powerful hurricanes. Eta hit Central America in November. It caused destruction from Panama to Florida. Iota came two weeks later. It was even more powerful. 

 
Scientists say climate change is to blame.  are increasing. Climate change is affecting how storms behave. It’s making them stronger. James P. Kossin is a scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. “These storms have a human fingerprint on them,” he told TIME for Kids. 

 
Storm Science
Hurricanes begin in the ocean. They take their energy from ocean air. The water in the Atlantic is getting warmer. That means more energy for storms. Winds blow faster. And there is more rain.

 
Storms are moving more slowly, too. So they have time to cause more damage. In 2017, Hurricane Harvey  for days. It flooded parts of Texas. “That storm was devastating,” Kossin says. “It just sat there. And it rained and rained.”
Scientists can help cities plan for big storms. Dereka Carroll-Smith works at the National Institute of Standards and Technology. She studies data on communities most affected by hurricanes. These include areas with many elderly people or mobile homes. Carroll-Smith’s research helps cities make plans for  people. “At some point, intense storms are going to be devastating to everyone,” she says. 

 
We need to slow climate change, Kossin says. Reducing greenhouse gases is the first step. “We can stop making it worse. Then we can [start] adapting to the new climate we’re in.”

111,111,Hurricane Basics,"{'Science', 'Weather'}","
A hurricane is a mass of clouds and thunderstorms. It spins around a still center. The center is called the “eye.” A hurricane is like a giant engine. It uses warm air as fuel. There’s plenty of that in the Atlantic Ocean during hurricane season.
A hurricane starts as a tropical storm. It’s called a hurricane when winds reach 74 miles per hour. Then the hurricane is rated. It gets a number, 1 to 5. The number depends on wind speed. A Category 5 hurricane is the strongest. Winds can top 157 miles per hour. This storm can cause great damage. 
The National Hurricane Center (NHC) is located in Florida. Its scientists watch the oceans. They study images from satellites in space. They use computers to analyze data. They let people know if a big storm is on the way.

 
The NHC also sends airplanes into hurricanes. The planes bounce on strong winds. They fly straight into a storm’s eye. Scientists on board collect data. “There’s none better than the NHC when it comes to forecasting hurricanes in real time,” James P. Kossin says. “It helps emergency planners prepare for a busy season.”

Who should take out the garbage? Who gets to pick what to watch on TV? To make a decision, some people play rock, paper, scissors. “It is a special sport,” Wyatt Baldwin told TFK. He is president of the World Rock Paper Scissors Association.

 
Baldwin is skilled at the game. He once had a 43-game winning streak. The secret to his success? “Look for patterns in your  moves,” Baldwin says. 
Ready to Rock
People have been playing rock, paper, scissors for a long time. The game was probably played in China about 2,000 years ago. Today, people play it all over. In Indonesia, it’s known as semut, orang, gajah. This means “ant, person, elephant.” The Japanese version of the game is called janken. People in Singapore play bird, stone, water. Some  use different hand symbols. But the idea of the game is the same worldwide. You face off against an opponent. Each player “throws” one of three hand symbols. You win, lose, or tie. (See “Who Wins?”)

 
Many people think rock, paper, scissors is all luck. Your chances of winning or losing seem the same. But the game is not completely random. All serious rock, paper, scissors players know this. A 2014 study in China found two key patterns in the way people play. Winners tend to repeat their winning hand symbols. But losers tend to go from rock to paper to scissors. 
So what’s the best way to win a game of rock, paper, scissors?  players think about their next move. They also think about what their opponent’s next move might be. “There are lots of different  that are always running through my mind,” Baldwin says. 
In order to get good at the game, he recommends practicing. “You can try practicing against yourself in front of a mirror,” Baldwin says. “But for me, that always ended up in a tie.”

On August 28, 1963, people poured into Washington, D.C. They came for a special event. It was called the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. It drew about 250,000 people. They wanted the United States government to pass new laws. These laws would give equal rights to all Americans.
That day, Martin Luther King Jr. gave a big speech. It became known as his “I Have a Dream” speech. It’s one of the most important speeches in U.S. history. “I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their ,” King said. His voice soared over the crowd. King spoke for 18 minutes.  

The March on Washington showed Americans the power of peaceful . It also brought about change. The next year, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed a bill into law. It banned . 
The Life of a Leader 
King was born in Atlanta, Georgia, in 1929. He became a minister. In Montgomery, Alabama, he preached about equality for all. But in the 1950s, Black people and white people were often separated. They went to different schools. They ate at different restaurants. Many Americans did not want it this way.

In 1955, Claudette Colvin protested in Montgomery. She refused to give up her bus seat to a white person. Rosa Parks did the same thing. Both were arrested. But these brave people moved the country forward. 
King also risked his safety for change. In 1963, he was arrested at a march in Birmingham, Alabama. This only made him work harder. He joined other  leaders. They planned the March on Washington.

Today, people are still fighting for equal rights. King’s words continue to inspire people around the world.

Lewis spent his life fighting for equality. In 1963, he walked beside Martin Luther King Jr. at the March on Washington. Lewis spoke at the event. “How long can we be patient?” he asked. “We want our freedom, and we want it now.”

In 1965, Lewis helped lead another march. It began in Selma, Alabama. About 600 protesters pushed for voting rights for Black people. Police met them at the Edmund Pettus Bridge. Protesters were ordered to turn back. They refused. Some were attacked. The nation was outraged by the violence. But the march drew support for the Voting Rights Act. Five months later, President Johnson signed it into law.

The pirarucu (pee-ra-roo-koo) is a big, ancient fish. It can weigh 300 pounds. “It needs to breathe air,” Nepstad says. People catch the pirarucu when it comes up for air. The fish can tip a canoe over as it lashes around.

The sloth lives high up in the trees. Its fur is the same color as the forest. That protects the sloth from . “They’re concerned about being found,” Nepstad says. Sloths come down to the forest floor about once a week.

Feeling sad is natural. But you can make a habit of feeling positive. Then sadness will pass more quickly. How do you do it? By noticing the good things in life. “We can practice bringing happiness to ourselves,” Carter told TIME for Kids. “It is like putting money in the bank. We can be ready for hard times in the future.”
How To Be Happy

How can you practice happiness? You can observe your emotions, even when you are feeling blue. “Look inside yourself with curiosity,” Carter says. You can ask yourself: What do I feel? Where in my body am I feeling it? Does it have a color? A shape? Believe it or not, this will make you feel better.

Think About It

Taking a look at your feelings helps you feel better. So does putting them into words. Why? A feeling starts deep inside the brain. If the feeling stays there, it may never go away. But when you talk about an emotion, it moves to the front of the brain. When it gets there, you start to understand it. That makes you feel better.

155,155,On the March,"{'Community', 'Culture'}","
One morning in June 2020, hundreds of people gathered in Saint Paul, Minnesota. They started marching down a tree-lined street. They carried signs: “No Justice? No Peace” and “Love, Respect, Equality.”

There were numerous marches in Saint Paul in the spring of 2020. People were  racism. They wanted Black people to be treated fairly. But this protest was different. Most of the people marching were kids.
“Children have a lot to say if they are given a chance,” Maggie Barnes told TIME for Kids. Barnes runs a day-care center in Saint Paul. She organized the march. “Kids have a  to be heard.”
Standing Up 
Marching is a way for kids to share their thoughts and feelings, Barnes says. It is a way of showing they want to change the world. 

Aidan Carter, 10, agrees. He led a kids' march in Portland, Oregon. This year, there have been protests there, too. Hundreds of marchers joined Aidan. “I felt like one of the big people,” he says. “Even though you’re little, you can still be brave and stand up for rights.”

Standing up for the rights of others can make you feel good, Barnes says. At the end of the march in Saint Paul, a boy named Malachai ran up to her. “I love you,” he said. “I want a hug.”
Barnes was wearing a mask. It was for protection against the new coronavirus. She bent down to hug the boy. “I could not deny him,” she says. 
Signs of Hope

At marches, protesters often carry signs. A sign is a way of expressing feelings, ideas, or beliefs. It shows what the protester wants to achieve by marching. 
Usually, signs are homemade. They may use words and pictures. There have been many colorful signs at kids’ marches.

Kids have long fought for justice in the United States. Look back to May 1963. Hundreds of Black children skipped school to march in Birmingham, Alabama. They were protesting segregation. Segregation is the practice of keeping Black and white people apart.

Freeman Hrabowski is a president at the University of Maryland. He was 12 in 1963. He remembers Martin Luther King Jr. visiting his church. King asked kids to fight for civil rights. Hrabowski was inspired to march. “King believed in us,” he told TIME for Kids. “We have to believe in our kids. They have to be  to play a part in our democracy.”

The Not-Too-Late Show with Elmo is a new talk show. It is hosted by the popular Sesame Street character. In each episode, Elmo gets ready for bed. He does this while chatting with special guests.
The show premiered this week. It can be seen on the new streaming service HBO Max.
TFK caught up with Elmo. Here’s what he had to say about this fun new show.

Q: Why did you want to host a talk show before bedtime?
A: Elmo loves making people laugh and learning about his friends and putting on a show, so Elmo thought hosting his own talk show would be a lot of fun! We tell jokes and sing songs and play games with celebrity guests, all before Elmo’s bedtime. Elmo goes to bed at 7:30. That’s why it’s Not-Too-Late. 
Q: Who are some guests who will appear?
A: So many amazing people visited The Not-Too-Late Show: Lil Nas X and Ciara and Blake Lively and the Jonas Brothers! Nick and Kevin and Joe even helped Elmo’s daddy with the dishes after the show! Oh—and Batman!
Q: What is your favorite game to play?
A: Definitely the tricycle race! No, no. Freeze Dance. Or maybe Beach Ball Ballyhoo? We play too many fun games on the show. Elmo can’t pick just one!
Q: What’s your favorite part of the show? 
A: Elmo’s favorite thing about The Not-Too-Late Show is that Elmo gets to work with all of Elmo’s friends. Cookie Monster is Elmo’s cohost, and Rosita is the stage manager, and Abby Cadabby is the head writer. Elmo even has a house band: Mama Bear and the Monsters! Everybody helps out. Elmo also likes wearing his snazzy suit.
Q: Why will kids love The Not-Too-Late Show?
A: Elmo had a lot of fun making it, so Elmo hopes everybody will have fun watching it!
Q: What do you do when you miss playing with your friends?
A: We’re learning new ways to play together. When Elmo misses Cookie Monster or Abby or any of Elmo’s friends, we have a virtual playdate. Elmo just learned that word: vir-tu-al! Elmo’s mommy and daddy set up a camera so Elmo can see everybody and play games on video calls. Elmo’s favorites are Freeze Dance and Elmo Says. That’s like Simon Says—but with Elmo.

Meet Daniel Botelho. He grew up near a beach in Brazil. As a boy, he loved diving and taking pictures of turtles. Now Botelho is an underwater photographer. He takes pictures of marine life for  in the U.S. and other countries. 
“I want to show the world all kinds of beautiful fish and animals,” he told TIME for Kids. Here, Botelho talks about four of his photographs.
Close Call

 Botelho enjoys swimming with great white sharks. But on this trip, he took pictures from the boat. 
“I observed that they were on the hunt that day,” he says. “I needed to respect the sharks’ comfort zone.
A Big Risk 

When Botelho saw this Portuguese man-of-war near his home, he ran to grab his camera. But he forgot one thing: gloves. The creature stung his hand. “I was so happy to take the photo,” he says. “I didn’t really care that I got stung.”
Sea Fun

It is rare to see an ocean sunfish. The fish spends most of its time in deep waters. It is one of the heaviest bony fishes in the world. It is also shy. So Botelho was surprised when one followed him for an hour. “It was one of the best  of my life,” he says. 
Gone Fishing

Sardines gather in what is called a bait ball. They form a mass. Sometimes, it protects them. But a dolphin can trap them. It releases bubbles from its blowhole. The bubbles create a net for the sardines. “It was amazing to see,” Botelho says.

Sea turtles are ancient creatures. They have been around since the time of the dinosaurs. A sea turtle spends most of its life underwater. But female sea turtles lay eggs on the beach. And all sea turtles must come to the ocean’s surface for air. There are seven species of sea turtles. Many of them are endangered. Habitat loss puts the reptiles at risk. So does plastic litter in the oceans. What makes sea turtles so special? Read the diagram to find out. 

1. Sea turtles have long flippers. These are shaped like paddles. The turtles use their flippers to move through the water.
2. Some turtles can bring their legs back into their shell. But sea turtles cannot.
3. Sea turtles have a smooth shell. This makes them super swimmers. They can swim long distances.
4. No teeth? No problem. Sea turtles have sharp jaws. This helps them slice through food.
5. A sea turtle’s eyes are like swimming goggles. They help a turtle see clearly underwater.
6. Sea turtles breathe air just like people. They rise out of the water to breathe air through their nostrils.

Elevators can feel like magic. Step inside. Select your floor. Poof! The elevator quickly takes you where you want to go.  
But an elevator doesn’t run on magic. It’s a machine. And it’s made up of several smaller machines. These machines work together to make the elevator move. An electric motor powers the elevator. A pulley system  the car up and down through an elevator shaft. The controller is the “brains” of the elevator. When you push a button, the controller tells the car which floor to go to.  

The Sky’s the Limit
Elevators are an important part of the modern world. “They make taller buildings possible,” Dot Mynahan told TIME for Kids. She works for the Otis Elevator Company. “Elevators are also important for handicapped people,” Mynahan says. “They make buildings more  to everyone.”

The first passenger elevator was installed in 1857, in New York City. Since then, technology has improved. Elevators have become more energy- efficient. They are also much faster. Have you heard of the Empire State Building, in New York City? Its elevators whisk visitors from the ground floor to the 86th floor in less than a minute. 
What’s next for elevators? “The possibilities are endless,” Mynahan says.    

A Historic Moment

Elisha Graves Otis was an inventor. He created the world’s first safety elevator. In 1854, he gave a daring demonstration of how it worked. Crowds gathered at the World’s Fair, in New York. Otis rode his elevator high into the air. A man cut the rope that was lifting it. The crowd gasped. The elevator should have fallen, but it stayed in place. “All safe, ladies and gentlemen,” Otis said, “all safe.”

The world’s fastest elevator is in Shanghai Tower, in China. This elevator can go 67 feet per second. That’s almost as quick as the top speed of a cheetah, the world’s fastest land animal. Whoosh! 


The Burj Khalifa is the world’s tallest building. It’s in Dubai. Tall buildings need fast elevators. The Burj Khalifa’s elevators are the third-fastest in the world. They go from the ground to the roof in a minute and 22 seconds.


Introducing the world’s tallest outdoor elevator. The Bailong elevator is on the side of a cliff, in China. It’s in a national park. The elevator rises 1,070 feet into the air. Would you have the courage to ride in it?


This first-ever sideways elevator is being tested in Germany. It’s propelled by powerful magnets. It can travel up and down, too! Some people say it’s the elevator of the future.

167,167,Coronavirus Questions Answered,"{'Health', 'World'}","
The new coronavirus is a public health emergency. The disease is spreading around the globe. 
Coronaviruses are a group of viruses. They can infect animals and people. Some cause mild illness, like the common cold. Other cases can be more serious. The type causing the current pandemic is new to scientists.
The new coronavirus was first found in China. That was back in December. On February 11, the disease that it causes was officially given a name. It is called COVID-19. It moved quickly around the world. Now, scientists and doctors are working together to stop its spread. They are working together to find a cure, too. 
TIME for Kids spoke with Dr. Juan Dumois. He is an infectious-disease specialist. He works at Johns Hopkins All Children’s Hospital. It is in Florida. He answered our questions about COVID-19. Here’s what he had to say.
Question: The coronavirus causes an illness called COVID-19. What are its symptoms?
Answer: Symptoms include fever, coughing, and shortness of breath.
Q: What should I do if I have these symptoms?
A: If you’re sick, tell a trusted adult. Symptoms can be treated. It may take a few days to a week to feel better.
Q: How does the virus spread?
A: If you’re near someone who coughs or sneezes, you can inhale the virus. If they cough or sneeze on a surface, you can pick up the virus by touching it. Avoid getting the virus by washing your hands.
Q: How dangerous is the virus to kids?
A: Children seem to be much less affected than adults. If kids do get sick, they’re less likely to have severe symptoms.
Q: What can I do to stay healthy?
A: Before touching your face, wash your hands for 20 seconds—that’s “Happy Birthday” two times—with soap and running water, or use hand sanitizer. There are also things you can do to strengthen your immune system. That helps the body fight off infections. Your immune system can be made stronger if you eat a healthy diet. Getting enough sleep is also important.
Q: What should I do if I’m feeling anxious about COVID-19?
A: Don’t be shy about talking to a parent, a teacher, or to another trusted adult. Feeling out of control can also make you anxious. But you can have some control by following safety and health guidelines.
Q: What are some common myths about the virus?
A: One myth is that wearing a mask is all you need to protect yourself from COVID-19. Washing your hands properly and frequently is more helpful.
Q: What can schools do to protect students?
A: Schools should make hand sanitizer available. That’s really important. Hand sanitizer needs to be rubbed on both hands, and it should take at least 15 seconds to dry. Doorknobs and desks should also be wiped down at least once a day, or ideally after each class.

Lab-grown meat starts off as tiny  that are safely taken from animals. Scientists feed the cells . The cells grow and multiply to form meat. 
Challenges Ahead
The world’s population is growing. People need to be fed. Lab-grown meat may be one solution.

Regular meat production requires a lot of cows. Cows release a gas that harms the environment. They also take up land. But lab-grown meat uses fewer cows and less land. “You only need the land for the facility” where the meat is made, Elliot Swartz told TIME for Kids. He works at the Good Food . 
Lab-grown meat is not in stores. It costs too much money. The first lab-grown burger was made in 2013. It cost $300,000 to make! Also, the government still needs to make sure lab-grown meat is safe to eat. But one day, you may see it in your grocery store. Would you like to try lab-grown meat?

Click. Click click. Click. Steve Forrest is in Antarctica. He’s standing on a rocky cliff. Below him are hundreds of chinstrap penguins. 
Forrest is a biologist. He uses a metal clicker to count every penguin he sees. It’s not easy. It’s snowing. The wind is howling. And the fluffy chicks won’t stay still!

Forrest is part of a team working on a penguin census. The census will help scientists better understand the Antarctic environment. 
Over the years, the number of chinstrap penguins in Antarctica has gone down. “Our best guess on why that could be is ,” Noah Strycker says. He’s on the  team. 
Scientists say climate change is making the ocean warmer. This may be hurting krill. Chinstraps eat these tiny shrimplike creatures. But krill are hard to study. So scientists focus on penguins. If penguins aren’t doing well, it probably means krill aren’t either. “Penguins give us an idea about what is going on in the ocean around us,” Forrest says. 

Drone Solution
This year, robotics engineers are helping Forrest with the penguin census. They fly a drone over the penguins. The drone takes pictures. Forrest’s team will use the photos as a record of each  location and size. It will also use the photos to teach computers to spot penguin nests. That way, computers could one day use satellite cameras to count penguins. For now, Forrest and his team will keep on clicking.

Japón está probando un nuevo tren bala tipo maglev. Es el tren más rápido del mundo. Alcanza velocidades de 375 millas por hora. Esto es más que el doble de la velocidad más alta del Acela Express, el tren más rápido en Estados Unidos. 
Maglev es una abreviación de “magnetic levitation” (levitación magnética). Este tren no solo funciona sobre ruedas. También flota. Imanes poderosos en el tren elevan al tren cuatro pulgadas en el aire. También lo propulsan. Y debido a que el train no toca las vías, no hay fricción. Esto significa súpervelocidades.

Japón espera tener el tren maglev en uso para el año 2027. Viajar no será lo mismo. La capital del país, Tokio, está a 218 millas de la ciudad de Nagoya. El viaje lleva casi cinco horas en auto. El maglev lo hará en 40 minutos. 

Japón no es el primer país en construir un tren magnético. China ha usado uno por años. Pero ese es más lento. Viaja entre Shanghai y su aeropuerto a una velocidad máxima de 268 millas por hora.

The next day, one person joined Greta in her strike. “That was a big step, from one to two,” Greta told TIME. Then a few more joined her. Then came hundreds of people. Then came thousands. The young activist had sparked a movement (see “Wave of Change”). 

Fighting for the Future
Greta first learned about climate change in elementary school. She saw a video that showed extreme weather and flooding. Her teacher explained that these were because of climate change. This made Greta worried. 

Today, Greta is 17 years old. She gives speeches and meets with world leaders. She demands that people take action to protect Planet Earth. She has inspired millions of others to protest for the future of the planet.
In August 2019, Greta set out on a zero- sail from the U.K. to the United States. Last September, she spoke to world leaders at the United Nations Climate Action Summit, in New York City.

Hard Knocks

A concussion is a brain injury. It can happen with a hard blow to the head or body. Concussions can be serious. A person with a concussion might look confused. He or she might stumble or pass out. Later, a person might become dizzy or get a headache. Or he or she might just not feel right. If you suffer a serious knock to the head or body, tell an adult right away.

Sports can be a lot of fun. They are also a great way to get exercise and stay healthy. But it’s important to stay safe. Here are four ways to take care of yourself while playing. 
Move and Stretch

 Before playing, it’s good to warm up. Go for a light jog. Learn the proper ways to stretch. This will lessen your chances of getting injured.
Listen Up!

Rules aren’t only meant to keep the game fair. They are also meant to protect you. Listen to your coach. He or she will keep you and your playmates in the game.
Wear Protective Gear.

Protective gear includes helmets, pads, and mouth guards. Different sports require different gear. Make sure your gear fits properly. 
Drink Water.

The body needs water. When you sweat, your body loses water. That’s why it’s a good idea to keep a water bottle nearby during play. Take a break and drink up!

187,187,Remaking Money,"{'United States', 'Government'}","
Imagine you’ve been saving money to buy a new scooter. Finally, you’re ready to make the purchase. But your envelope of cash is missing. Then you make a shocking discovery. Your brother accidentally put the envelope through a paper shredder. Your cash is confetti.

Don’t panic. The U.S. government can help you get your money back, Eric Walsh says. He works for the U.S. Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP), in Washington, D.C. The BEP is the government office that prints paper money. Walsh works for the BEP’s Mutilated Currency Division. His team figures out the value of  money. Then BEP repays the person who sent it in.

 
“It’s a  job,” Walsh told TIME for Kids. “Some of these cases are just giant jigsaw puzzles.”
Patience Pays Off
Water and fire are the most common causes of mutilated pieces  of currency. “The toughest cases are the burnt ones. The  shrink and look like Monopoly money,” Tina Barnett says. She’s a BEP examiner. Her job is to work with damaged bills.

To make sure a bill is real, Barnett uses a microscope to read its fine print. She also uses special lights. Otherwise, the job is “pretty low-tech,” Walsh says. “Examiners go through each note and piece it together by hand.” They use simple tools, such as tweezers, glue, and tape.
The hard work is worth it. “For some of our customers, this is their life savings,” Walsh says. “So it’s very rewarding to be a bright spot in people’s lives.”
The Money Factory

The U.S. Bureau of Engraving and Printing has a nickname: the Money Factory. Why? Each year, it prints billions of dollars’ worth of paper money. It was founded in 1862, in Washington, D.C. Public tours are available. But don’t expect to see nickels or dimes. Coins are made by the U.S. Mint.

The tiger is an  animal. There are only 4,000 wild tigers left in the world. But their number is rising. That’s thanks to efforts in India. In July, the country announced that it had nearly 3,000 tigers. That’s more than half of the world’s wild tigers!
A Place of Their Own 

India has set aside land for tigers. On these , tigers can spread out and hunt. Sometimes, they come across people or animals. India’s government has moved villages away from reserves. This protects farm animals from hungry tigers. It also protects tigers from angry villagers.

The United States Supreme Court is the nation’s highest court. It heads the government’s  branch (see “Government Branches”).

The court’s job is to solve disagreements. It hears around 80 cases a year. These cases affect citizens’ rights. They also raise important questions about the law. The court is made up of nine judges, called justices. Each is picked by the president and approved by the Senate. Justices may serve for life.

The Supreme Court was created in 1789. That was two years after our country’s founders wrote the U.S. Constitution. The Constitution lays out rules for how the government should work. The Supreme Court’s role is to make sure the president and Congress follow the Constitution. The court can tell the president if his or her actions are allowed. It can also tell Congress that a law is .
Historic Decision
Supreme Court rulings affect all Americans. One important case was Brown v. Board of Education, in 1954. Oliver Brown had sued the school system in Topeka, Kansas.

His daughter, Linda, was not allowed to attend the school closest to her home. It was an all-white school. Linda was black. Her father thought this treatment was unfair.
The Supreme Court heard Brown’s case. The court ruled that the Constitution gives equal rights to all children in the U.S. The court said having separate schools for black and white children was unconstitutional. The case helped to end  in U.S. public schools. The results still touch our lives today.
Government Branches

The U.S. Constitution divides the nation’s government into three branches, or parts. Each branch plays an important role in shaping our country. Learn about what each branch does. See how they work together!
The SUPREME COURT heads the judicial branch. It can decide that a law made by Congress is unconstitutional. The court can also stop an order by the president.
The PRESIDENT leads the executive branch. He or she signs bills into law. The president has veto power, too. This means he or she can stop bills from becoming laws.
CONGRESS is the legislative branch. It is made up of the House of Representatives and the Senate. Members of Congress can vote on making bills into laws.

The surface of Mars is dry and rocky. There are no plants or animals on Mars. There’s not enough oxygen to breathe, either. Did the planet ever support life? NASA’s sending a robot to find out.

The Mars 2020 rover is a robotic scientist. Its job is to look for clues that there was once life on the Red Planet. “Robots can help us answer big scientific questions,” Katie Stack Morgan told TIME for Kids. She’s a NASA scientist. “It’s hard to send humans to Mars. We’ve never done that before. But we know how to send robots.”

Looking for Clues 
NASA will launch the rover next summer. In February 2021, it will land in a crater called Jezero. The crater was once filled with water. Tiny  called microbes may have lived there long ago.
The rover’s camera will look for rocks that may contain fossils. Its seven-foot arm will reach out to drill and scrape. Rock samples will go into tubes. Future missions may bring those tubes back to Earth for study.

The rover will also run experiments. It will test a small helicopter. This will tell scientists how flying vehicles would work in Mars’s . The rover will also test a machine that makes oxygen. The oxygen could be used to burn rocket fuel. Astronauts who travel to Mars in the future could use the fuel to get back to Earth.
“Are we alone in the universe?” Stack Morgan asks. “Or could life have developed on another planet?” The Mars rover could help us find out.
Mars By the Numbers

A year is the time it takes a planet to go around the sun. A year on Mars lasts 687 days. That’s almost twice as long as a year on Earth.

Tyler Mitroff, 10
Bethesda, Maryland

School uniforms are a great idea! In a school without uniforms, some students might wear expensive clothes. Kids who can’t get nicer clothes might be judged by their appearance. But uniforms help make kids feel equal. They’re also good for school spirit. With uniforms, all kids can feel like a part of the community.

The group throws parties for kids who do not have a  home. Many of the parties take place in a homeless shelter. For some kids, it is the first birthday party they have had.
Happy Birthdays
The Birthday Party Project is on a mission. The group wants to make every kid feel special. “Everybody deserves to feel celebrated,” Paige Chenault told TIME for Kids. She started the Birthday Party Project in 2012. The group’s first celebration was at a homeless shelter in Texas. 

Today, the Birthday Party Project hosts about 50 monthly parties in cities around the country. Nearly 10,000 kids have celebrated their birthday at these events. 

Dipson, 8, is one of those kids. He lives in a  housing community in Minnesota. At a party in March, he and other kids played ring toss and ate cupcakes. They also opened presents. “It was very fun,” he says. 

Jamie Gates works in Dipson’s community. She says the Birthday Party Project has held parties there for years. Kids always look forward to them. “Parents come and party too,” she says. “It brings the whole place together.”
How To Help

There are many ways you can help other kids feel celebrated. Volunteer with an adult for a group like the Birthday Party Project. Raise money by hosting bake sales and other events. Donate gifts to a local homeless shelter. Make birthday cards for kids living in difficult situations. Everyone can pitch in!

229,229,Waste Not,"{'Food and Nutrition', 'Environment'}","
Each weekday, some 30 million students in the United States eat a school lunch. Then they fill cafeteria trash cans with uneaten food. 

Wasted food is a waste of money, a missed chance to feed hungry people, and bad for the environment. That’s why schools are trying to reduce the amount of food that winds up in the trash. “We don’t want good food to go to waste,” Nancy Deming told TIME for Kids. She works for the Oakland Unified School District, in California.  
Fighting Food Waste
Schools have several ways to cut down on food waste. Students are often hungrier after active play, so having lunch after recess can reduce waste. Making the lunch period longer also helps. It gives kids more time to eat. 

In Oakland, schools set up share tables. Students put untouched food on the share tables, and other students can take the food if they want it. Uneaten food is served another day or donated to charity. Food scraps are turned into . 
Taste Test
Sometimes, students waste food because they don’t like how it tastes. Chef Sam Icklan wants to change that. Icklan works for a program called Chefs in Schools. He helps cafeteria staff create recipes kids enjoy. 

In one school, kale often went untouched. Icklan used the kale as a pizza topping and called the dish Green Monster Pizza. Kids loved it. “It became this beautiful,  dish,” he says. “Who wouldn’t eat that?” 
Fight Waste
 Buy “ugly” fruits and veggies. They’re just as tasty as perfect-looking produce. Read safety labels. “Best before” means it’s safe a little while after that date. “Use by” means it’s no longer safe after that date. Start with small portions. If you’re still hungry, you can take more later. After meals, use scraps for compost.

Imagínate esto: Vives en una aldea en Botsuana, África. Sales de tu casa una mañana y comienzas a caminar hacia tu escuela. De repente, un elefante gigante está parado en tu camino. 
“Es realmente aterrador cruzarse con un elefante cuando estás a pie”, dijo Kate Evans a TIME for Kids. Evans es la fundadora de Elephants for Africa (Elefantes para África, EFA por sus siglas en inglés). El grupo está en Botsuana. Trabaja para proteger a los elefantes contra la caza furtiva. La caza furtiva es capturar o matar ilegalmente a un animal. 

Compartir la tierra
Los elefantes han encontrado seguridad por bastante tiempo en Botsuana. Esto se debe a que mucha de la tierra está protegida. Es ilegal cazar elefantes en tierra protegida. En años recientes, más elefantes han migrado a Botsuana. Hoy, alrededor de 130,000 de ellos deambulan por el terreno.

Pero los elefantes entran en las granjas. Se comen y aplastan los cultivos. Han lesionado y matado también a personas. Algunos granjeros responden matando a los elefantes. “La amenaza más grande de los elefantes es el conflicto con los humanos”, dice Evans. “Un tercio de la población de elefantes está entrando en contacto con las personas”.
El objetivo de EFA es ayudar a las personas y a los elefantes a vivir juntos pacíficamente. Mantiene un registro de dónde van los elefantes. Además, el grupo lleva a estudiantes en viajes para que aprendan sobre los mamíferos. 

Walona Sehularo trabaja para EFA. Enseña a los niños que los elefantes no deben ser temidos. “Muchos en mi país piensan: ‘¿Por qué debería importarme los animales?’”, dijo a TFK. “Pero la única manera para que las cosas mejoren es que sea importante para las personas”.
Transformador de la tierra

 Los elefantes transforman el medioambiente. Aplastan el pasto. Derrumban árboles. Marchan a través de arbustos. Este tráfico crea caminos para animales más pequeños. Además, los elefantes esparcen semillas alrededor cuando caminan. Esto ayuda al crecimiento de nuevas plantas.

“It’s really scary to come across an elephant when you’re on foot,” Kate Evans told TIME for Kids. Evans is the  of Elephants for Africa (EFA). The group is based in Botswana. It works to protect elephants from poaching. Poaching means illegally capturing or killing an animal. 

Sharing the Land
Elephants have long found safety in Botswana. That’s because much of the land there is protected. It is illegal to hunt elephants on protected land. In recent years, more elephants have  to Botswana. Today, around 130,000 of them roam the land. 
But the elephants wander onto farms. They eat and  crops. They’ve hurt and killed people, too. Some farmers respond by killing the elephants. “The biggest threat to elephants in Botswana is  with humans,” Evans says. “One-third of the elephant population is coming into contact with people.”

EFA’s goal is to help people and elephants live peacefully together. It keeps track of where the elephants go. The group takes schoolkids on trips to learn about the mammals, too. 
Walona Sehularo works for EFA. He teaches kids that elephants shouldn’t be feared. “Many in my country think ‘Why should I care about the animals?’” he told TFK. “But the only way things get better is if people care.”
Earth Shapers

Elephants shape the environment. They trample grass. They knock down trees. They trudge through bushes. This traffic creates pathways for smaller animals. Plus, elephants spread seeds around as they roam. That helps new plants grow.
Elephants even help other animals find water. An elephant uses its tusks to dig in the ground for water. This gives other creatures a place to drink.

Many creatures migrate. They travel in big groups from one place to another. Some animals migrate when the weather changes. Others set off to find new sources of food and water. 
Lots of animal migrations take place in Africa. Here, you can read about three of them.  

As the seasons change, ZEBRAS travel in large groups. A big group of zebras is called a dazzle. Some dazzles migrate 300 miles. They make the trip year after year. Why do zebras go so far? They are looking for better grass to graze on. Hundreds of thousands of zebras make the journey together. That’s a lot of stripes. 

Here come the WILDEBEESTS. These African antelopes are always on the move. They travel by day and by night. Their journey can take them through rivers and streams. Wildebeests are good swimmers. But crossing the water is dangerous. Sometimes, wildebeests migrate alongside zebras. Both mammals munch on grass.

Bird migrations are common in Africa. Take FLAMINGOS, for example. These pink birds fly together in V formations. They head for Africa’s salt flats. A salt flat is a body of water that has dried up. During the rainy season, a salt flat becomes a wetland. It’s a great habitat for flamingos. They like to feast on tiny creatures, such as shrimp. Tasty!

239,239,Making a Magazine,"{'Community', 'Books'}","
A lot goes into making a magazine. Stories are written by writers. They are  by editors. Words and pictures are arranged on the page by designers. Here’s the inside scoop on how TIME for Kids is made. 

1. The Morning Meeting
Welcome to TFK’s daily meeting. At our office in New York City, we get together every morning. We gather to talk about what needs to get done. We also talk about what to put in the magazine. Our meetings keep us organized! Sometimes, we have only a day or two to work on a story. Getting things done takes teamwork and communication. 

2. Picking Photos
Photos are an important part of a magazine. They help tell the story. Writers, editors, and designers meet to select photos. We look at many photos and choose the best ones. 
Here, TFK editorial director Andrea Delbanco and creative director Drew Willis look at photos for a story on moon exploration. How do we decide which photos to use? “The  of the story must be clear,” says TFK designer Stephen Blue. 

3. Writing the Story
First, a writer does research on a story. He or she reads about the topic and talks with experts. Here, TFK’s Rebecca Katzman meets with Jeffrey Kluger, of TIME. Kluger wrote about moon exploration for TIME. Katzman  his story for TFK.
Finally, the writer  the story. After that, an editor reads it. The editor makes changes and offers suggestions.

4. Designing the Page 
A designer works on the story layout. He or she moves photos and text around on a page. There’s a computer program to edit photos. There’s another program to move things around. 
See the text on this spread at right? It’s called “dummy text.” It helps the designers know where to put the photos. It also shows the writer how much space he or she will have in which to tell the story.

5. Copyediting 
A copy editor is the last person to look at the story. Mike DeCapite (pictured) is one of TFK’s copy editors. He reads through every page of the magazine. He corrects mistakes. He fixes grammar and punctuation. He also rewrites awkward sentences. 
“No matter how many people have looked at something, it can always use another look,” DeCapite says. “I miss a lot of things the first time myself.”  

6. The Final Check 
TFK’s production team looks over the magazine. They fix photos. They examine page proofs on a light table. They go over each page and make sure everything looks right.  
Finally, the magazine is sent off to TFK’s printing plant. It is in Wisconsin. There, millions of copies of the magazine are printed. The copies are put together. Then the magazines are mailed to schools all across the country. Now they’re ready to be read by you and your classmates!

But coral reefs are in trouble. That’s why people are building artificial ones. The reefs are made from large objects placed on the ocean floor. Over time, coral starts to grow on them.
Help for Troubled Waters

Artificial reefs can be built using many types of material. They can be made of limestone, steel, and concrete. Sometimes, structures that are no longer being used are recycled to create reefs. That is what happened with the Tappan Zee Bridge.
 Many artificial reefs are made using old ships. In 2005, Jim Walsh helped turn a ship into a reef. The ship was called the Carthaginian II. Walsh says it is now home to 75 animal species. “It’s amazing to see how much life is on that ship,” he says. 

Coral 
Tiny, colorful creatures called algae live on coral. When ocean waters get too hot or too cold, the algae go somewhere else. Without algae, the coral has no food. Its color fades. This is called coral bleaching. Sometimes, the coral dies.

The world’s largest reef is the Great Barrier Reef. It is in Australia. About 93% of this reef has been harmed by coral bleaching. Scientists say climate change and pollution are to blame.

Being aware of the weather can help keep people safe. That’s where meteorologists like Marsh come in. Meteorologists are scientists who study the weather. They use tools such as satellites and radar. These tools help them predict when a storm is coming and how bad it will be. By making predictions, meteorologists can warn people when  weather is on the way.
What’s the best way to stay safe during a thunderstorm? “When you see lightning, it’s time to go inside,” Marsh told TFK. “And when you’re inside, stay away from the windows.”
Thunderstorms can be loud and . But they’re nothing to be afraid of. “You don’t need to be scared of thunderstorms if you take the proper actions,” Marsh says. “Just think of thunderstorms as grumpy clouds.”
It’s Striking! 

Lightning is a quick, powerful burst of electricity. It forms in a storm cloud. Lightning happens fast. And it is more than five times hotter than the sun. Lightning can flash inside a storm cloud. It can flash from one cloud to another. It can also strike the ground.
Thunder is the sound that lightning makes. But we hear a clap of thunder after we see a flash of lightning. That’s because light travels much faster than sound.

Tornadoes and hurricanes are cyclones. That’s a storm of spinning winds. Tornadoes and hurricanes are powerful, and they can be dangerous! 
A tornado is a spinning funnel of wind. It makes a roaring noise. Tornadoes form over land. Most come from giant thunderstorms called supercells. They can stretch from the sky to the ground. 
Tornadoes are nature’s most powerful storms. The wind speeds in tornadoes can be 300 miles an hour. A tornado can topple houses and send cars flying through the air. 
Hurricanes are tropical storms. They form over warm ocean water. Sometimes, they reach land. Heavy rains from hurricanes can cause flooding. The winds can cause damage.The center of a hurricane is called the eye. 

The eye of a hurricane is calm. It’s possible to fly an airplane into a hurricane’s eye. The ride is a little bumpy. But some weather scientists do it to get helpful data about these storms.

Monarch butterflies fly to warmer places when the weather gets cold. Many go to California. 
But their numbers are falling. Every year, the Xerces Society counts monarchs in California. It found fewer than 30,000 of the butterflies in 2018. That’s 86% fewer than in 2017. 
Bad weather may have kept the monarchs away. But habitat loss and pesticides could also be to blame. Researchers say it’s not too late to help monarchs. “There is still hope that we can recover the population if we work quickly,” the Xerces Society says on its website.

Sometimes, the idea for a story comes out of thin air.
Matt de la Peña was talking with a teacher at a playground one day. Suddenly, the wind kicked up. Dandelion puffs filled the air. A boy was standing next to the teacher. He said, “Look, the sky is full of wishes.” To de la Peña, that sounded like a poem. “When I heard that, I knew I wanted to mold a story around that image,” he told TIME for Kids.

The Gift of Childhood
The story de la Peña wrote is Carmela Full of Wishes. It is about a girl and her brother doing Sunday errands. Like his other picture books, it is written in poetry.
“A picture-book writer has two jobs,” de la Peña says. “You have to get the story right. Then you have to get the music right.” Reading aloud is like singing a song, he says. “There is music in the way a story is read. It can help you understand the book differently.”

Getting the music right can take work. De la Peña wrote about 50  of Carmela.
He leaves some of the story to the reader’s imagination. The book ends with a sky full of dandelion puffs. Carmela makes a wish. But we never find out what she wishes for. “The point is that she’s free to wish,” de la Peña says. “The gift of childhood is possibility.”
Meet the Illustrator

Christian Robinson is an illustrator. He did the pictures in Carmela Full of Wishes. He also did the artwork for Matt de la Peña’s book Last Stop on Market Street. “I just love that so much can be  with an image,” Robinson has said. His pictures help us imagine a story.

Poetry is a way of playing with language. Poems can have a rhythm, and poems can rhyme. Poems can be made up of full sentences or just groups of words. Some poems have a . Others do not. Read on to learn about three new poetry books for kids. 
Listen to the Music

Do you know the TV show Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood? Fred Rogers, the host, wrote songs for kids. A BEAUTIFUL DAY IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD brings together the words to 75 of them. Luke Flowers illustrated the book. As a kid, he was a fan of the show. “Being part of this book is a dream come true!” he told TFK.

261,261,Best Inventions of 2018,"{'Inventions', 'Technology'}","
Inventions have the power to help people. They change the way we live, work, and play. Each year, TIME magazine picks the year’s best inventions. Here are six that TFK thinks will improve the world. Read on to learn about these amazing objects. 
A Safer Ride

Biking in the dark is dangerous. A man named Eu-wen Ding almost learned this the hard way. He forgot his lights. He was nearly hit by a car. So he thought of a better way to ride. He came up with the LUMOS KICKSTART HELMET. It has bright lights. They make a cyclist more . They also blink to signal a turn. Riders can  the signal from their handlebars.  
Better Wheels

More than 3 million Americans use a wheelchair. But most wheelchairs are heavy. They can be hard to move around. The WHILL MODEL CI is a new type of wheelchair. It has special front wheels. They allow it to climb over things. The chair can be used indoors or outdoors. It can move around in tight spaces. It can also be taken apart in minutes. This makes it easy to . 
Ready to Fly

It’s a bird! It’s a plane! It’s a flying suit! Gravity Industries has made the GRAVITY JET SUIT. It has five mini jet engines. Two are built into each of the hand units. One is built into the backpack. The jets shoot a person into the air. The suit can fly up to 50 miles per hour. For now, the suits are expensive. They are also loud. Richard Browning helped invent the suit. He wants the next one to be quieter and cheaper.
Get in the Game

Some people have trouble using their arms and hands. That makes it hard for them to play video games. Microsoft invented the XBOX ADAPTIVE CONTROLLER. It helps these gamers. It is a larger  of a classic controller. The buttons are big. They can be pressed with an elbow or chin.
Sweet Shoes

Making some kinds of shoes can hurt the planet. Allbirds wants to change that. The company is testing a new material. It is called SWEETFOAM. It is made from the sugarcane plant. It uses parts of the plant that are usually thrown out. Allbirds first used SweetFoam to make flip-flops. Now the company plans to use it in different kinds of shoes. It hopes others will make things out of SweetFoam, too. 
Homes for All 

The ICON VULCAN 3D PRINTER can build a tiny house in just two days. How? It creates the house layer by layer. It uses concrete. This costs less than other ways to build a house. ICON is the company behind the printer. In the future, it hopes to make a house in just one day. It wants to take the printer to places where more houses are needed.

A patent is a legal document. It stops people from copying an inventor’s idea. The U.S. began giving out patents in 1790. Here are a few inventions that have received patents.
Cotton Gin

ELI WHITNEY got a patent for the cotton gin in 1794. It was a machine that quickly cleaned cotton. This made it easier to make cloth for clothing. 
Electronic Lightbulb

THOMAS EDISON was given a patent for an electric lightbulb in 1880. Edison got more than 1,000 patents for inventions.
Airplane

WILBUR AND ORVILLE WRIGHT got a patent for a “flying machine” in 1906. They invented the first successful airplane.

Polar bears live in the Arctic. They spend their days on sea ice. That’s where they hunt for food. But large areas of sea ice are melting. This has put the mammals at risk. That is according to a new report.  The report is from the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC).   
In Canada, polar bears are listed as an animal of “special concern.” This means they are not yet . But they could be in the future. “We will need to keep a close eye on this ,” said Graham Forbes. He is part of the COSEWIC team that studied the bears. 
No Room to Roam

Melting sea ice is the top threat to polar bears. They need sea ice to stand on while they hunt. Seals are their main food source. Polar bears wait on the ice for seals to pop up from the water. Then they pounce. Less ice means less area to hunt.   
It will take 20 to 40 years to see how loss of sea ice affects polar bears, Forbes told TIME for Kids. “Nobody knows what will happen.”

268,268,Kid Coders,"{'Technology', 'Engineering'}","
On most weekends, you can find Zoe Stone (not pictured), 8, in front of a computer. But she isn’t playing games or watching videos. She’s learning how to code.    
Code is a set of instructions. It tells a computer what to do. Coders, or programmers, are the people who write the instructions for a computer. Coders make websites and , or apps. Apps can be used for everything from playing games to checking the weather. 

Coders solve problems and work together. They know how to think big and small. 
Cracking the Code  
Zoe has been coding since she was 4 years old. She uses coding to create art, solve puzzles, and  games.
Zoe likes coding because it is creative. “Coding is really fun,” she told TIME for Kids. “You can show your personality in what you make.”
How did she learn how to code? Zoe takes classes at Code.org. The website offers hundreds of free coding lessons for kids. In fact, more than 29 million students in 180 countries use it.

The nonprofit hopes to bring coding to even more kids. “We believe that every child should have the opportunity to learn about computers and coding,” Alice Steinglass told TFK. She is the president of Code.org.
For kids looking to give coding a try, Steinglass suggests “Hour of Code.” It’s an  lesson at Code.org. 
“Computers are part of our world,” says Steinglass. “It’s important for kids to understand how they work.”

Coding Language

People around the world understand different languages. Computers do too. There are many coding languages. One is called Java. It can be used to do difficult math very quickly. Another language is HTML. It is used to make words and pictures appear on a computer screen. Coding languages use words, letters, numbers, and symbols.

Computers are all around us. We use them to play and to learn. Some make chores easier. Others help keep people safe. All computers work because of coding. Where do you see coding at work in the world around you?
Is there a SMARTBOARD in your classroom? It is a type of computer. Code tells smartboards how to work. Smartboards help children learn. They are interactive. That means they respond to a person’s touch.

People use code to design COMPUTER GAMES. Coders create characters and fantasy worlds for the games. Players can drive a car, play sports, and more. With coding, the possibilities are endless.

Green means “go.” Red means “stop.” Code tells TRAFFIC LIGHTS when to change colors. Some of them can sense when a car pulls up. Others work on a timer. All traffic lights help keep people safe. We can thank coding for that. 

WASHING MACHINES clean our clothes for us. They make our lives easier. Code tells the machine how hot to make the water or how long to run. A washing machine can be programmed to follow different cycles.

Does the president like his pizza crust thick or thin? What are his favorite vegetables?
It is Cristeta Comerford’s job to know. She has been  chef at the White House since 2005. She can make any kind of food the president wants.
Where did the nation’s top chef learn to cook? Comerford grew up in the Philippines. She remembers her mom’s cooking. “I learned so much from her,” Comerford told TFK. “I still use  she taught me.”
Comerford uses ingredients from the White House garden. It is filled with vegetables and herbs. There is honey in a beehive. In the kitchen, her team of chefs starts cooking. Pots boil. Pans sizzle. The team follows her instructions to the last detail. 

Dinnertime 
For Comerford and her team, perfection is the goal. After all, her dishes are served to the First Family and their guests.
This past spring, President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump hosted a state dinner for nearly 130 people. The French president and First Lady were the guests of honor. The dinner was held to celebrate the friendship between the United States and France.

The first course was a French cheese dish and salad. The main course was rack of lamb. It came with rice cooked with herbs from the garden. Dessert was a nectarine tart made with White House honey.
The dinner was a success. “When the plates come back clean and empty,” Comerford says, “this is the best  to any chef.”
Nibbler in Chief

U.S. presidents enjoy the meals their chefs prepare. But sometimes, they just want a snack. George Washington liked to eat nuts. Franklin D. Roosevelt enjoyed grilled cheese sandwiches. And Abraham Lincoln? He preferred a sweet treat from his childhood. From the time he was a boy, he had a taste for gingerbread cookies.

Josh Lee, 12 
Chicago, Illinois

Plastic straws are bad for our planet. When people throw them away, they end up in our oceans. Sea animals sometimes mistake the plastic for food. This can harm the animals. It might even kill them. It’s okay for people to use straws. But there are other options besides plastic ones. People can buy paper or steel straws to carry with them.

Plastic straws should not be banned. Why? Many people with disabilities rely on flexible straws for drinking. Plus, plastics can be used many times. My dad and I wash and reuse nontoxic plastic straws. Finally, banning plastic straws won’t save the oceans. Instead, we should teach people how to throw away trash so it doesn’t end up on beaches.

Personas pisaron por primera vez la Luna el 20 de julio de 1969. Fueron parte de la misión Apolo 11. Después de esta, NASA envió seis misiones más a la Luna. Pero el gobierno de Estados Unidos dejó de pagar por misiones lunares. NASA no ha enviado una tripulación a la Luna desde 1972.

Ahora NASA está planeando un viaje de retorno. En diciembre de 2017, el presidente Donald Trump firmó un plan. Coloca a la exploración lunar en el primer lugar de la lista de NASA. “Estamos trabajando para tener astronautas en la Luna para mediados de 2020”, dice Bill Gerstenmaier. Él trabaja para NASA. 

Todos a bordo
NASA está construyendo la Plataforma Gateway Orbital Lunar. Gateway orbitará, o viajará, alrededor de la Luna. Será una mini estación espacial. Los astronautas la usarán como base. Viajarán de Gateway a la Luna y de regreso en una nave pequeña. Podrán pasar mucho más tiempo en la Luna que antes. 
Gateway estará formada por cinco partes principales. Estas partes se llaman módulos. Uno o dos módulos alojarán a los astronautas. Cada uno será del tamaño de un autobús escolar. Otro convertirá a la luz solar en energía. Habrá un módulo hermético para los astronautas que hacen caminatas espaciales. Además, habrá un puerto donde naves espaciales pueden atracar.

 Otros países podrían ayudar. Rusia podría construir un módulo hermético. Japón podría construir uno para ayudar con la energía y las comunicaciones. Canadá puede que construya un brazo robótico. Este podría ayudar con el trabajo en el exterior de Gateway.
El Congreso de EE.UU. necesitará también estar a bordo. Depende de ellos proveer el dinero para construir a Gateway.

Gateway will be made of five main parts. These parts are called modules. One or two modules will house astronauts. Each will be the size of a school bus. One will turn sunlight into power. There will be an air-lock module for astronauts who go on spacewalks. There will also be a port where spacecraft can dock.

Other countries may pitch in to help. Russia may build an air-lock module. Japan might build one to help with power and communications. Canada could build a robotic arm. It would help with outdoor work on Gateway. 
The U.S. Congress will need to get on board too. It’s up to them to provide money to build Gateway. 
On Deck: Mars

India’s Taj Mahal is one of the most famous buildings on Earth. Tourists from around the world go to visit. But  is harming the white marble building. India’s government is scrambling to fix the problem. 
“Earlier, it was turning yellow, and now it is becoming brown and green.” That’s what court justices in India said, according to the Times of India. “It is very serious.”  

Action Plan
The Taj Mahal is nearly 400 years old. It was built by Emperor Shah Jahan as a  to his wife. It sits on the polluted Yamuna River. The river attracts insects. They leave markings on the building. Air pollution is also harming the monument. India has some of the worst air pollution in the world. 
Steps have been taken to  the Taj Mahal. Nearby factories have been closed. That improves air quality. And the Taj Mahal has gotten a serious cleaning. 
But India’s Supreme Court is worried about the building’s future. Lawmakers have called for plans to protect the Taj Mahal. Those plans are due on November 15.

Scientists have made a discovery about a 500 million–year-old fossil. A new study shows it was formed by an animal. It was one of the earliest creatures on Earth. 
The first fossil of this kind was described in 1947. The creature that formed it was nicknamed Dickinsonia. Its fossils were found in Australia and Russia. But scientists never knew if it was made by a plant or an animal.
Research has now proven that Dickinsonia was an animal. Jochen Brocks was part of the team that studied the fossil. He told the AP that scientists still have a lot to learn about Dickinsonia. “We do know it was soft and flexible,” Brocks said. “Maybe like a slug, but less watery than a jellyfish.”

Sitka isn’t the only place with a Fish to Schools program. The city of Dillingham, Alaska, has a Salmon to Schools program. There are similar efforts in other states, like Oregon and Massachusetts. 

Sitka’s Fish to Schools program is part of a trend. Many U.S. schools are working to add fresh, local foods to the menu. More schools are teaching about healthy eating, too. That’s according to the National Farm to School Network. “School lunch doesn’t have to be the same everywhere in the country,” Fujioka says. “If you want kids to eat it, you should serve the kinds of foods they’re used to eating.”

Seven dolphins live at the National Aquarium, in Baltimore, Maryland. They have spent their whole lives in .      

But soon, the dolphins will get a new home. The aquarium will close its dolphin  by 2021. The dolphins will be moved to a sanctuary. That is a protected space. The sanctuary will be more like a dolphin’s natural .
Some scientists now believe dolphins can’t stay happy and healthy in aquariums. That’s one reason why the dolphins are being moved. New research shows that wild dolphins are very active. In the ocean, they dive down hundreds of feet. They travel up to 100 miles a day. Captive dolphins cannot do these things. 

Some animals born in captivity can be placed in the wild. But dolphins usually cannot. A dolphin’s mother teaches it to hunt and stay safe. Humans can’t teach those lessons. That’s another reason why the aquarium’s dolphins are being moved to the sanctuary. They will have more freedom. But they will still be protected.
A New Model 
The aquarium hasn’t decided where its sanctuary will be. But it will be connected to the ocean. And it will have plants and other animals. The dolphins will have lots of room to swim. But trainers will still care for them. Visitors might be able to see them from far away.

Leigh Clayton works at the National Aquarium. “We are creating a new model for how humans and dolphins interact,” she told TFK.  
What's That Sound? 

Dolphins make two types of sounds: whistles and clicks. They use a high-pitched whistle to communicate with one another. Each dolphin’s whistle is unique. 
Dolphins use clicks to get a sense of their surroundings. A dolphin’s clicks create vibrations. The vibrations travel through the water. They bounce off objects like plants and animals. Then the vibrations return to the dolphin. This is how dolphins use sound to “see.” It is called echolocation.

Messages from the Past 

Why did ancient Egyptians  their dead? They believed their ancestors would live on in a world after death. That’s why Egyptians preserved the Gilded Lady’s body. They thought she would see, hear, taste, and smell with the help of her golden mask.
Pictures taken with a CT scanner gave scientists clues about what the Gilded Lady looked like. A scan of her skull showed that she had an . Another scan showed that she had curly hair. An artist used this information to make a sculpture of the Gilded Lady. 

Ellen Futter is the president of AMNH. She calls mummies “messengers from another time.” With the help of technology, we will continue to unwrap mummies’ secrets.
How Mummies Were Made

In Egypt, rulers and wealthy people were mummified after death. Here’s what it takes to make a mummy. 
1. Wash the body.

292,292,Welcome to the Crayola Factory!,"{'Business', 'Arts'}","
Step into the Crayola factory in Easton, Pennsylvania. Humming machines and busy people are hard at work. Each day, the company makes 13 million crayons. The crayons are used by kids around the world.    
“There’s a great  for crayons,” says Elizabeth Rieland. She is an engineer at Crayola. She solves problems. This includes looking for better and quicker ways to make crayons. “We use automation,” Rieland says. This means using robots and machines to help get the job done. 
Making Crayons 

Crayola makes its crayons in large . They are made of heated wax and pigment, or color. A pipe pours the liquid mixture into . This forms the crayons, which harden as they cool. 
Next, a machine pushes the crayons out of the molds, and they are lifted by a robotic arm. It puts the crayons on a conveyor belt, which transports them to another machine. Its job is to wrap a label around each crayon.
Finally, workers pick up the labeled crayons. They put them in a machine called a collator. It picks one crayon of each color and puts them into boxes. Now boxes of crayons are ready to be sent to stores. Crayola crayons are sold in more than 80 countries. 

Rieland is always trying to improve the production process. “Every year, we try to get better at one thing,” she says. “This year, it’s putting crayons into the boxes.” 
Rieland also gets to help pick names for new crayons. Crayola has more than 100 colors. “It’s a fun time to be in the crayon business,” she says.

A Smart Solution
What happens to imperfect crayons? Inspectors look at the crayons before they are packaged. They gather up the broken and chipped ones. These crayons are sorted by color, and will be melted back down. This way, they can become part of another batch of crayons. This keeps imperfect crayons from going to waste.

She says they set off alone from South Sudan to Kenya. (Their parents came later.) That was in 2014. Rose has lived at Kakuma refugee camp ever since. 

“There was a war in my country,” Rose says. In fact, civil war still rages in South Sudan. “I am hoping that after I finish school, my life will be changed completely,” Rose says.
Rose, 18, is a refugee. A refugee is a person who has fled his or her country due to war. Other reasons can also play a role. A 1951 United Nations agreement explains refugees’ rights. One is the right to education for children. 
In March, I visited Kakuma camp and Kalobeyei . I went with UNICEF, the United Nations Children’s Fund. I wanted to learn what life is like for kids who go to school in refugee camps.

The sun goes down in the Sonoran Desert. A truck pulls up. Poachers step out. They dig up a giant saguaro (sa-wah-ro). They wrap it in a carpet. Then they drive away.
 Cactuses are disappearing. People are stealing them. A 2015 study found that poaching is the top threat to cactuses. “Entire populations of cactus have been wiped out almost overnight,” Kim McCue told TFK. She is a director at the Desert Botanical Garden, in Arizona. “People go in and pluck them all out.”
Poachers can sell a saguaro for $1,000 or more. “This is the most  plant of the Sonoran Desert,” Richard Wiedhopf told TFK. He is president of the Tucson Cactus and Succulent Society. “People want saguaros in their yard. They are willing to pay a lot of money to have one.”

Saving the Saguaro
All cactuses in Arizona are protected. It is illegal to remove one from public land without a permit. Authorities at Saguaro National Park are fighting poachers. They are using microchips. Chips have been placed in more than 1,000 saguaros there.
Not all cactuses taken from the wild are dug up illegally. Nurseries can rescue plants that grow in the way of new roads and buildings. These cactuses can be sold if they have a  tag.

Conservationists are fighting to save cactuses. Why? Cactuses are an important part of desert culture. Creatures live in and around them. Humans and animals feast on their fruits. “If you lose the cactus, you’re going to lose other things too,” McCue says. “Cactuses help hold the desert together.”
Get to Know the Saguaro

Building Characters
How does an idea grow? Willems keeps track of his thoughts as they come. “I draw things over and over again,” he says. “And I come back to ideas over time.” Sharing his ideas also helps. Willems gets feedback on his work. He shows it to people he trusts. An editor, an agent, and his wife weigh in. 

After developing a character, Willems plays around with how it will look. He uses many tools for his illustrations. He tries out different types of pencils, brushes, crayons, and paper. First, he makes his drawings. Then he traces over them in ink or charcoal. Finally, he uses a computer to add color. 
The Making of Funny

These numbers come from the Solar Foundation. Roxie Brown is a program director there. She told TFK that the number of schools with solar panels is still rising.

A Bright Future
Sunlight is a renewable resource. That means it won’t run out. Solar panels don’t hurt the environment. Also, sunlight is free. So solar power can help schools save money. 
Brown thinks more schools should run on solar power. “The sun is Earth’s energy source,” she says. “We are trying to make it the energy source for our houses, cars, and schools, too.
”Switching to solar isn’t always easy. Solar panels can be costly. They also take up space. But for many schools, it’s worth it. “We’re doing things to help the world as a whole,” Miller says. 
Teachers can use solar panels to teach students about renewable energy. “The kids talk about [solar power] in the classroom,” Miller says. “Then they can go look at it in action.”

POWERING UP

Solar panels harness the sun’s energy. They turn the sun’s rays into power that people can use. Look at this chart to see how solar panels work. 	
1. Sunlight hits solar panels.	
2. There are tiny particles in the panels. They are called electrons. Sunlight makes them move.	
3. The movement creates electricity. The electricity is used to power a building.	
4. Extra electricity flows into power lines. Others can use it.

Joris Hutchison, 11, has always loved cheetahs. He was upset to learn that the big cats might go extinct in his lifetime. 
Joris asked his mom what he could do to help. They got in touch with a wildlife sanctuary in Namibia. That is in Africa. 
Joris began raising money. He sold T-shirts, flowers, and lemonade. He held garage sales and skating parties. “I’m just a normal kid who decided to do something about a problem,” Joris told TFK Kid Reporter Christopher Nguyen. 
So far, he has raised more than $14,000. The money is used to buy special collars. The collars track the cheetahs. This helps protect them from being killed. Joris has also visited the sanctuary in Namibia. He has spent three summers volunteering there. “We need to raise awareness and tell people what’s happening,” Joris says. “It needs to be stopped.”

There are fewer than 2,000 pandas in the wild. People are working to raise that number. Qian Qian (pronounced chen chen) is a panda cub. She lives at Chengdu Panda Base, in China. She stars in a new IMAX movie. It is called Pandas. The film follows Qian Qian (shown below) as she goes into the mountains for the first time.
The film was directed by Drew Fellman (pictured). He told TFK his favorite thing about pandas is how they smell. “They smell like bamboo ice cream,” he said. He also said that pandas are surprisingly fast.
The movie is narrated by Frozen star Kristen Bell. It hits theaters on April 6.

People are using bioluminescent animals to solve problems. Take GARY and KATHY LUKER. They are scientists. They study cancer. Bioluminescence gives them information about the disease. This information would otherwise be invisible.
In their work, the Lukers turn to glowing creatures like click beetles. The insects have organs that make light. The light is red or green. The Lukers studied chemicals in the beetle’s organs. Then they made the chemicals in a lab. They used them in experiments.  
In one experiment, the chemicals made healthy cells glow red. They made cancer cells light up green. That made it easy for the Lukers to tell the cells apart. Their research helps them find drugs to fight cancer. “Seeing [glowing creatures] inspires researchers,” Gary Luker says.

Picture a glowing world. Light-up trees line city streets. Glowing plants replace table lamps. This may seem like science fiction. But it could happen.
A company called GLOWEE is looking to glowing creatures for new ideas. Glowee grows tiny, bright bacteria. Then it uses the bacteria to light store windows and street signs. 
What’s next for the company? It is working to make the light shine brighter and last longer.

312,312,Nature's Bright Lights,"{'Animals', 'Environment'}","
Have you seen a firefly glow? Fireflies are bioluminescent. That means they make their own light. “It’s like a flashlight or a lightbulb,” Hans Waldenmaier told TFK. He studies glowing mushrooms in Brazil. But bioluminescence can be found all around the world. 

Brilliant Creatures
Some glowing creatures live on land. But most live in water. About 80% are ocean-dwellers. 
Tiny plankton sparkle at the water’s surface. These organisms light up with motion. So they glisten with every wave. And the ocean depths are full of bioluminescence. Animals have adapted to the dark habitat by making their own light.

Time to Shine 
The ability to make light is useful for animals. It helps different creatures in different ways. Some use it to communicate. Some light up to find food or a mate. Other creatures light up to send out a warning or in defense. 
A vampire squid releases a glowing cloud. The light throws off predators. A dragonfish uses red light to hunt for food. Fireflies flash to attract mates. 
Unlike a lightbulb, a firefly does not use electricity. Glowing creatures create their own light by a chemical reaction. A firefly’s body contains special chemicals. When they mix, the reaction takes place. And that makes light.

In some places, nature’s glow is losing its spark. That is because of light pollution. The light from cities burns bright. It makes bioluminescence harder to spot. But it’s not impossible. “Just turn off your lights and go outside,” Waldenmaier says. “You’re going to see amazing things.”

313,313,Making Music,{'Arts'},"
In December, 400 musicians, young and old, marched onto a stage. One held a trumpet. It was wrapped in duct tape. Another carried a cello with loose strings. Others held broken violins, flutes, and drums. They took their seats. Then they played. 
The concert took place in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The music was written for broken instruments. It was part of a project called Symphony for a Broken Orchestra. 
The instruments had been sitting unused in schools. “There was no money to fix them,” Robert Blackson told TFK. He created the project in March 2015. “The goal is to get the entire city to care about these broken instruments.” 
Raising the Bar

Blackson and his team have collected more than 1,000 broken instruments from schools. Music lovers can hear what the instruments sound like by visiting the project’s website. Then they can pick one to sponsor. Sponsoring an instrument helps pay for it to be repaired. 
“With the money raised, we can repair [them all],” Blackson says. “We can get them back into the schools, where they belong.” So far, the project has raised more than $250,000. That’s enough to pay for 800 repairs. 
“At this rate, we will have all the instruments fixed up [for] the start of the 2018 school year,” Blackson says.
Striking a Chord
Symphony for a Broken Orchestra does more than fix instruments. It brings music to young people. It also shines a light on school music programs. “Music connects communities,” Joseph Conyers told TFK. He played a broken violin at the concert. “It gets young people to express themselves.”
Blackson hopes people will see each broken instrument as an opportunity. “Learning how to play music transforms us,” he says.

Inventions can change the world. Some are made for work. Others are just for fun. Some help people and the planet. Every year, TIME magazine picks 25 of its favorite new inventions. Here, TFK looks at six. These inventions make us excited about the future. Read on to see what’s special about each one. Which invention do you like best? 
Growing Under the Sea

What is the future of farming? It might be growing food on the ocean floor. That’s what Bren Smith says. He is the director of GreenWave. The group is leading the way in underwater farming. It is raising oysters, clams, and seaweed underwater. The idea isn’t as wild as it may seem. Farming on land can be harmful to the planet. And many oceans are overfished. GreenWave hopes to help. Its crops don’t use any . They even help fight climate change. 
The company is helping fishermen. It set up 14 farms in the United States. Now it plans to expand to Europe. 
Running Into the Future

Picture a shoe that lets you run faster and jump higher. That’s the idea behind the Futurecraft 4D. It’s a new sneaker from Adidas. The shoe has a special midsole. The midsole is the padding on the bottom. The Futurecraft 4D midsole can be altered to fit a wearer. 
What is the key to making the shoe so special? It is the 3D printing. Normally, it would take weeks to make a shoe like this. But this shoe’s midsole can be printed in two hours. That means Adidas could even make them in stores. That’s what the company hopes for the future. 
How did Adidas dream up this new shoe? They looked at 17 years’ worth of information from runners.   
More Ways to Play

Nobody likes to stop playing a great game when they leave home. With the Nintendo Switch, you don’t have to. It’s a handheld tablet. So users can play it away from home. It also has two controllers. They come off the sides. So more than one user can play. People seem to like the options. Switch went on sale in March 2017. In December, Nintendo announced that it had sold 10 million of them. 
A Safer Helmet

Football players wear helmets for protection. The helmets are made of hard plastic. But Sam Browd had an idea. Browd is a doctor. What if the outer shell were made of a softer material? Helmets could work like car bumpers. They could absorb some of the . 
Browd drew a plan on a napkin. Now a company called VICIS is working to make the helmet. “We wanted to build the safest helmet ever made,” says VICIS’s CEO, Dave Marver. The result is the Zero1. It is now being used by 18 NFL teams. About 20 college teams are using it too. Next up: a model for younger athletes.    
A Friendly Robot

There are many personal robots. Amazon Echo and Google Home are two you may know of. They can tell you the weather. They can play your favorite song.  
Jibo is different. His face uses icons to show emotions. He can giggle and dance. Jibo has six microphones. They let him known where sounds are coming from. So he can face you when you say, “Hey, Jibo.”
Jibo seems almost human. The technology is . And it could change how we interact with machines.   
Glasses That Help

Millions of people are legally blind. For them, getting around can be hard. Canes and guide dogs can help. But they don’t let people see. ESight 3 does. Think of it as the world’s most powerful glasses. 
When users put on eSight, it records high-quality video. It then uses special tools to turn those images into something the blind can see. The device lets users take part in a variety of sports and activities.
ESight costs nearly $10,000. The high price means not everyone can afford it. But it is cheaper than the company’s earlier versions. 
It’s also lighter and faster. So far, the company estimates that it has been used by more than 1,000 people.

It was September of 1957 in Little Rock, Arkansas. Carlotta Walls was 14 years old. She and eight other black teenagers walked toward Central High School. It was the first day of school. It was the best school in the city.
Other people were angry. They shouted at the teens. They did not want black and white students to go to school together. Guards would not let the teenagers into the building.  

Three weeks later, the teens were able to attend their first day of school. This time, another group of soldiers protected them. 
The teens were among the first black students in the United States to go to an all-white school. They came to be known as the Little Rock Nine. 
Leading the Way
Black children and white children couldn’t always go to school together. In 1954, the United States Supreme Court made a decision. They said segregation in public schools was illegal. All students would now be able to go to the same schools.
The teens in Little Rock showed great courage. They were leaders in the U.S. civil rights movement. The group received a Congressional Gold Medal in 1999.

Step into a toy store. On your left, there are action figures and toy cars. On your right, you see craft kits and dolls.
Many stores put “boy” toys in one place. They put “girl” toys in another. They do this based on stereotypes. A stereotype is an untrue belief about people or things. Stereotypes are often unfair. For example, someone might say toy cars are only for boys. They might say dolls are only for girls. These are stereotypes about gender. They are not facts. 
Taking Sides
Many people are taking a stand against gender stereotypes in toys. In 2015, Target made headlines. The company said its stores would no longer direct people to buy some toys for girls and others for boys. Target said in a statement that it did not want shoppers “to feel frustrated or limited by the way things are presented.”
Many people support Target’s move to mix up toys. They say kids should not be told to like one toy or another. Instead, they say kids should be able to choose what they want to play with. It is healthy for kids to play with many types of things. 
Others think toys should still be sorted by gender. They say that makes choosing toys easier. It is good for toymakers and toy stores. It can bring them more business. They can make and sell the same toy in two different colors. For example, a sister and brother might not share their toys. Then their parents would buy them twice as many toys. So toy companies would earn more money.

335,335,Should Stores Separate Toys by Gender?,"{'The View', 'Debate'}","
Many stores put toys aimed at boys in one place. They put toys aimed at girls in another. Some people like this. Others do not. Here, two kids share their views about this matter. 
YES
Preston Eubanks, 11
Syracuse, Utah

Stores should continue to separate toys aimed at boys from those aimed at girls. It is helpful. It makes a store more organized. For kids, it’s easier to find what you are looking for. Say you’re looking for a superhero toy. You know not to look in the doll section. You can find the toy more quickly. Who cares if aisles are separated? Boys and girls can still get whatever toy they want. If a girl is looking for a Hot Wheels set, she will know where to find it. No one is telling her not to play with it.
NO
Phedre Perkins, 11

Toy stores should not sort toys by gender. A toy is a toy! A girl might want to play with a “boy” toy. Who cares? It’s just a toy! Companies don’t care about you. They care about making money. Sometimes, kids just pretend to like something. They do this to try to fit into a mold. It’s not healthy for kids to grow up trying to be someone else. Kids should play with many types of toys. Kids should try everything! If they don’t, they might miss out on a hobby, an interest, or even a future job. Let’s let all kids be themselves.

Glowing hot lava sputters from the peak. Chunks of rock shoot into the sky. The ground rumbles. The air is thick with ash and smoke. A volcano is erupting.
A volcano is an opening in the Earth. Magma, or hot melted rock, bubbles deep underground. Pressure builds. It forces the fiery liquid toward the top. Boom! Magma shoots through the vent. It is called lava when it hits Earth’s surface.

Most volcanoes are found in the Ring of Fire. That is a belt around the Pacific Ocean. But others are near cities. When one is ready to blow, people must  for safety.
An active volcano might erupt at any time. But not all volcanoes are active. A dormant volcano seems to be sleeping. But it might erupt again one day. Extinct volcanoes have not erupted for thousands of years. They are no longer a threat.
Shaping the Planet
Volcanoes are powerful forces of change. They have made our planet look the way it does. A volcano can wipe out an entire town. It can also create new land. For example, the Hawaiian Islands were formed by volcanic eruptions. 

Volcanoes can be . When a volcano blows its top, heat is released from the Earth. This helps keep the planet cool. Ash from volcanoes is healthy for plants. It adds minerals to soil. And people tap into volcanic heat beneath the Earth. We use it as a source of energy. This energy can power homes. It is a clean and natural way to make things run. 
Volcanoes can be dangerous. But new tools are helping scientists learn more about the fiery giants. Scientists use what they learn to keep people safe from harm.
A Hot Job

What do you call a scientist who studies volcanoes? A volcanologist! Volcanologists try to predict when a volcano will erupt. They use special instruments to listen for rumblings from a volcano. They collect rock samples and study the flow of lava. A volcanologist’s job can be dangerous. New  technology is making the job safer.

The Ring of Fire is a 25,000-mile-long belt around the Pacific Ocean. It is home to many volcanoes. In fact, three-quarters of the Earth’s volcanoes are here. That’s more than 450 volcanoes! The Ring of Fire sits along the outline of several tectonic (tek-tah-nik) plates. Earthquakes are common here. 
Tectonic plates are huge pieces of Earth’s crust. They are like giant puzzle pieces. Most volcanoes form along their edges. The plates are constantly shifting. They move and change position. They pull apart and slide together. This movement creates space between the plates. Magma rises to fill in the space. Bam! A volcano blows its top.

Do you dream of riding in a flying car? Your dream might come true.
Companies are racing to make flying cars a real transportation choice. The machines will fly themselves. Experts say that will make them safer than regular cars.
The Flying Taxi
Dubai is a city in the Middle East. People there could soon be flying to work in air taxis. The Ehang 184 can fly for 30 minutes. It runs on battery power. It holds one person. Air-taxi riders use an app on their phone to ask for a flight. 

The Ehang 184 is one of several new flying machines. Such machines are known as VTOLs. That stands for “vertical takeoff and landing.” VTOLs lift into the air with the help of electric fans. VTOLs are quieter and cleaner than helicopters. 
Fast Forward
In the United States, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is in charge of air transportation. The FAA must do many things before it can approve VTOL flights. It must write safety rules. It also needs to come up with traffic rules. They are needed to make sure low-flying crafts don’t have accidents.
The FAA has approved the testing of a VTOL called the Transition. It runs on gas. It travels on the ground and in the air. The wings fold up when the vehicle is on the ground. They spread out for flight.

Carl Dietrich runs the company that makes the Transition. He says he wants to “make personal aviation a transportation option for everyone.” His company has also  a VTOL called the TF-X. He thinks everyone will be able to own a TF-X one day. But it won’t be ready for at least 10 years. 
For now, the world is watching to see how soon Dubai’s flying taxis get off the ground.

In March, astronaut Ricky Arnold will blast into space. He will live and work on the  Space Station (ISS) for six months. He is training for this mission now.
Life in space can be challenging. That is why astronauts go through training. “Things can change rapidly,” Arnold told TFK. “We need to be prepared.”

Out of This World 
The ISS is a giant space lab. It is the size of a football field. Astronauts from around the world are aboard. They do experiments. They observe Earth. They also fix the station.

Mission training begins about two years before liftoff. It covers many subjects. Astronauts learn what to do if there is a fire in the station. They find out how to fix the ISS. Astronauts also prepare for spacewalks. They do this by diving underwater. Being in a swimming pool feels a lot like being in space. 
Arnold says a safe mission involves working well with a crew. “That sense of teamwork is the best part of the job,” he says. 
A New Class
Becoming an astronaut is not easy. Earlier this year, NASA picked its newest group of astronauts. Just 12 men and women were selected. They were chosen from a group of more than 18,000.
These astronauts have already begun a two-year training program. It takes place at NASA’s Johnson Space Center, in Houston, Texas. They are studying spacecraft systems, , astronomy, and other subjects. “No two days are alike,” says Arnold.

347,347,Pass on Salt,"{'Health', 'Food and Nutrition'}","

Pizza and French fries taste good. The trouble is, U.S. kids are eating way too many salty foods like these.  
The salt we add to food is about 40% . Our bodies need some sodium. But too much is not healthy. 
The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) works to protect people’s health. It studied the eating habits of more than 2,000 kids. It found that kids eat about 1½ teaspoons of sodium each day. That is almost double the amount they should have. 
This worries Zerleen Quader. She works for the CDC. “Eating too much sodium now can set kids up for health problems later,” she told TFK.
Take Heart 

More than half the sodium kids eat comes from packaged foods. Much of the sodium is in unlikely places. (See “Rethink Lunch.”) 
Eating too much salt can raise blood pressure. That can lead to heart problems. One in nine children has raised blood pressure.  

How can you cut back on salt? Quader says to smart small. Read food labels. Pick items that have less sodium. “It’s surprising how much the sodium  for the same food can vary by brand,” she says. 
Bridget Murphy is a nutrition expert. She says kids should try adding spices to food instead of salt.  Eating more fruits and vegetables also helps. So does eating fewer store-bought and restaurant foods. Try it. Your heart will thank you.
Rethink Lunch

A turkey sandwich has more than 1,400 milligrams (mg) of sodium. What happens when you add a teaspoon of mustard? The total rises to more than 1,500 mg. Kids ages 9 to 13 should get no more than 2,200 mg of sodium each day.
For good health, look for foods with low or no sodium.

In the Field
The vets check on apes in the forest. Sometimes, a gorilla needs medical care. The vets quickly get to work. 

First, a helper aims a dart at the animal. If the gorilla seems to have an illness, the dart contains medicine. If the ape seems to need an operation, the dart contains a drug that makes it sleep and unable to feel pain.
Success Story
The gorillas Cranfield works with are . They have been hurt by habitat loss, illegal hunting, and disease. But there is hope. The mountain gorilla is the only kind of great ape whose numbers are growing. A recent study says Gorilla Doctors is the reason for much of that growth.

My Locker Is a Monster

My locker is a monster,
it’s absolutely true!
It eats my books, my bag, my pens:
Once it ate my shoes!

Its wide-open jaws
snatch everything in sight.
Goodbye, science homework!
There’s no doing you tonight.

You want to borrow a pencil?
I’m sorry, I’ve got none left.
I don’t have any paper, either.
My locker’s committed a theft.

I know I didn’t do my homework
but it isn’t even my fault!
My locker has it, of course,
hidden deep in its vault.

I’m always late to class,
I can’t go without my stuff!
I’d be better off without my locker,
because opening it is just too tough.

I can’t wait for the day
when my locker and I’ll have to part.
I’ve learned my lesson, I’m ready for high school.
No using a locker: I’ll use a shopping cart!

   To save its birds, New Zealand has a big plan to get rid of rats.
   New Zealand has a pest problem. The country has a plan to solve it. The country’s leaders want to get rid of rats and other  mammals by 2050.

   In New Zealand, rats are an invasive species. Long ago, rats came to the country on boats, with humans.
   Possums are also an invasive species. They were brought to New Zealand for their fur. But now there are too many possums in New Zealand. They eat the eggs and young of native birds.

   Each year, rats, possums, and other mammals kill about 25 million of New Zealand’s native birds. Many of these birds, including the kiwi, cannot fly. That is a big problem for the birds. They cannot fly to safety. As a result, several of New Zealand’s birds are nearly extinct.

A Big Goal
   New Zealand plans to spend more than $20 million to get rid of rats and other mammals. Traps and poison will be used.

   It is a big goal. But scientists say it can be met. “I really do think it’s possible,” says James Russell. He is a scientist. “It will require people working in every nook and corner of the country,” Russell says.

Some schools have placed limits on the fundraisers. Is that a good idea?

   Bake sales are popular. They help schools raise money. Families bake sweet treats. Students sell the treats. The school earns money. It is used to help pay for field trips. It is also used to pay for art and sports programs.

   But bake sales in Massachusetts are a little different. Students are not allowed to sell or buy sweets during the school day. The state follows the Smart Snacks rules. Another 23 states also follow them. These rules say food sold during the school day must be healthy.

   I think sweets should be banned from school because they aren’t good for children. Some schools have bake sales to raise money. But there are other ways to do that.

Learn about Australia’s Great Barrier Reef.
   The Great Barrier Reef is one of the world’s natural wonders. It is off the coast of Australia. Visitors swim in the sparkling waters around it. They see amazing views of sea life.
   The reef is also the largest living structure on Earth. It is so big that it can be seen from outer space.

A Great Loss
   This large, underwater treasure is dying. Coral reefs are made up of tiny animals called coral polyps. The polyps’ bodies build colorful reefs. But unhealthy reefs can turn white. This is called bleaching. The bleaching sucks the color out of the corals. Some corals die.
   A recent study found that 93% of the Great Barrier Reef has been hurt by coral bleaching. Warm water temperatures there are one cause of the bleaching. Pollution is another cause.
   David Kline is a scientist. He studies corals. He says reefs around the world are in trouble. “It is truly global, and it’s looking very ,” he says.

Reef Resources
   Reefs are important. They help protect communities near the coast from flooding. They attract visitors and bring jobs to the area. Reefs are also a habitat for sea life (see “Life in the Reef”).

February is Black History Month. But visitors to the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture celebrate black history every day. The new museum opened on September 24, 2016. It is in Washington, D.C.
   The museum honors black Americans throughout history. President Barack Obama spoke at the museum’s opening. “African-American history is not somehow separate from our larger American story,” he said. “It is central to the American story.”


A Place to Think
   The idea for the museum goes back about 100 years. (See “A Museum in the Making.”)
   Museum workers spent more than 10 years collecting nearly 40,000  to show there. Most of the items came from everyday Americans. They were excited to share parts of their history. The items were passed down from family members.
   The exhibits take visitors on a journey through the past. They also help them look at problems in the U.S. today. “Hopefully, this museum can help us talk to each other,” Obama said.
   The museum has quiet spaces for visitors to sit and think. There is an auditorium for events. The cafeteria is called the Sweet Home Café. It offers many dishes. The food gives a taste of African-American life.

 Grizzly bears have nearly disappeared from most of the United States. But they are making a comeback in and around Yellowstone National Park. By 1975, fewer than 140 grizzlies lived there. Now there are about 700. For this reason, the U.S. government says the bears should be taken off the -species list.
   Not everyone agrees. Some say the bears still face challenges. The loss of important food sources is one. Trout and elk have become harder to find.


 
 But the biggest challenge is hunting. If taken off the list, the bears would still be protected in Yellowstone. But states near the park plan to allow hunting.

On Veterans Day weekend, kids from military families enjoy the great outdoors.

 Most kids who go to camp go in the summer. But Charles Devine goes in the fall. Last year, on  Day weekend, he went to Camp Soaring Eagle. The camp is in Cornville, Arizona. 

   Charles’s favorite activities at the camp were horseback riding, archery, and fishing. He found it easy to make friends with the other kids. After all, they had something in common. All of the kids had a parent who was a veteran or in the .
   “They share an understanding of the special issues military kids face,” Teresa Devine told TFK. She is Charles’s mom. Military kids often have to get used to a parent being away from home, she said.

Honoring Veterans
   Max James and his wife, Linda, started Camp Soaring Eagle in 2007. The camp is free. For most of the year, the camp is for children who are ill. But on Veterans Day weekend, the camp is for military kids, like Charles. It’s a time to have fun!
   Juan Morales helps James run the camp. He served in the military for 25 years. “We see a need to honor our vet kids,” Morales says. Giving them a weekend at camp, he says, is a way to do that.

What Is Veterans Day?
   Veterans Day is celebrated each year on November 11. The holiday honors men and women who have served in the U.S. military.
   In 1919, President Woodrow Wilson set aside the day to honor military service and world peace. Congress made November 11 a legal holiday in 1938.
   One way people celebrate Veterans Day is by having parades. They are exciting to watch!

Tons of fruits and vegetables go into the trash each year. People are working to stop that from happening. 


 
Go to the store. Take a look at the fruits and vegetables sold there. Most are perfectly shaped. But not all  looks like that. Sometimes, vegetables grow crooked. Fruit is the wrong color. Those imperfect foods are not sold. Instead, they are thrown away. But some people want stores to sell “ugly” fruits and vegetables. They say it is a way to cut down on food waste. They think shoppers will buy and eat those foods.


 
“No one is perfect, so why should we expect fruits and vegetables to be perfect?” Jordan Figueiredo told TFK. “Ugly produce may be different-looking, but it is perfectly fresh and tasty,” he says.



Stores Get Onboard
   The food store Giant Eagle has started selling imperfect fruits and vegetables. It calls the foods “produce with personality.” Whole Foods Market also says it will offer ugly produce. It plans to sell the items at lower prices.



To get people interested, Figueiredo posts funny photos of ugly produce online. People like what they see. He hopes this will convince more stores to carry these items. “We are throwing so much good food away,” he says. “People understand how important this is.



Talk About It!
   Many communities have laws that say people must  paper and plastics. Now some places have passed laws that say food waste must be recycled too. The process of turning food waste into soil is called composting.
   Many foods can be composted. Some people want composting laws. They say the laws cut down on trash. Other people dislike the laws. They say composting is expensive and can be hard for people to do. What do you think? Should composting be the law?

Scientists are building a powerful telescope. It will help them see deep into space.
More than 400 years ago, Galileo Galilei built a telescope. He was an Italian scientist. He used the telescope to study space. Since then, scientists have used telescopes to make big discoveries. The Hubble Space Telescope was sent to space in 1990. It has sent back more than a million pictures.

Soon, a new telescope will take over for Hubble. It is the James Webb Space Telescope. It is also called JWST, and Webb.
In 2018, a rocket will take JWST into space. The new telescope will explore farther into space than Hubble. It will travel a million miles from Earth. This will give scientists a better view of the universe. “Hubble rewrote  textbooks,” Maggie Masetti told TFK. She works on the Webb project. “Webb is going to do the same thing.”
On the Hunt
Like Hubble, Webb will look for  far away. The telescope will also hunt for planets that are like Earth. It will do this by looking for light. Webb’s mirror will collect light from objects in space. Its special camera and tools will be able to find light that the human eye cannot see.

In the future, there will be more telescopes like Webb. “By the time kids grow up,” says Masetti, “the things they learn about the universe will be totally different from the things we think we know now.”

Hubble's View
It has been nearly 26 years since the launch of the Hubble Space Telescope. It has sent back more than a million pictures. Scientists have seen stars being born. They have studied faraway planets. Hubble’s powerful eye has helped us understand space. The telescope still has 10 years of life left. What more will it find?

Programas especiales ayudan a niños a comer mejor y a aprender sobre alimentos.



Destiny Cunningham, de 10 años, ama comer una “ensalada semáforo” para el almuerzo. Ella y otros estudiantes en su escuela, en Detroit, Michigan, ayudaron a recolectar los vegetales rojos, amarillos y verdes con los cuales fue preparada. Los vegetales crecieron en huertas en las escuelas de la ciudad. Destiny dice que crecer y recolectar los vegetales hace que sea “más significativo comerlos”.



Niños en Burlington, Vermont, también disfrutan comer alimentos locales en su escuela. Comen albóndigas y yogur de Vermont. Comen manzanas que crecieron en los alrededores.
“Casi todos los alimentos frescos son locales durante la temporada de cosecha”, dijo Doug Davis a TFK. Dirige el Proyecto de Alimentos para Escuelas de Burlington. Dice que pronto, la mayoría de la carne servida en las escuelas de Burlington vendrá de animales criados en granjas locales. “Nuestro movimiento de la granja a la escuela entusiasma a los niños sobre de dónde provienen los alimentos”, dice Davis.



Con arraigue
El gobierno de EE.UU. está trabajando para mejorar los programas escolares de huertas y agricultura. Dirige el Programa de la Granja a la Escuela. Brinda dinero a las escuelas. El dinero se usa para ayudar a obtener más productos locales en las cafeterías. Las escuelas también usan el dinero para enseñar a los niños a comer saludablemente.
Destiny y sus amigos toman clases de cocina en la escuela. Preparan ensaladas. Preparan licuados. ¡Qué rico! Los ingredientes provienen de la huerta de su escuela o de una granja cercana.
El año pasado, Destiny y sus compañeros de clase hicieron un viaje a una granja. Aprendieron cómo reciclar desechos de alimentos. Además, estudiaron los ciclos de vida de las plantas.

Special programs help kids eat better and learn about food.



Destiny Cunningham, 10, loves eating “stoplight salad” for lunch. She and other students at her school, in Detroit, Michigan, helped pick the red, yellow, and green vegetables it is made with. The vegetables grow in gardens at the city’s schools. Destiny says growing and picking the vegetables makes them “more meaningful to eat.” 



Kids in Burlington, Vermont, also enjoy eating  foods at school. They have meatballs and yogurt from Vermont. They eat apples that grew nearby.
“Nearly all  is local during harvest season,” Doug Davis told TFK. He leads the Burlington School Food Project. He says that soon, most of the meat served in Burlington schools will come from animals raised on local farms. “Our farm-to-school movement gets kids excited about where food comes from,” Davis says.



Taking Root
The U.S. government is working to improve school garden and farming programs. It runs the Farm to School Program. It gives money to schools. The money is used to help get more local products into cafeterias. Schools also use the money to teach kids about healthy eating.
Destiny and her friends take cooking classes at school. They make salads. They make smoothies. Yum! The ingredients come from their school garden or a nearby farm.
Last year, Destiny and her classmates took a trip to the farm. They learned how to recycle food waste. They also studied the life cycles of plants.

President Joe Biden nominated Jackson in February. “We’ve taken another step toward making our highest court reflect the diversity of America,” he wrote on Twitter after Jackson was confirmed. 
Jackson has spent much of her career as a federal judge. She will now be the first Black female Supreme Court justice. “I have now achieved something far beyond anything my grandparents could have possibly ever imagined,” she said, speaking from the White House lawn on the day after the Senate vote.

Astronomers have discovered the earliest, most distant star ever seen. It is nicknamed Earendel. The star formed about 13 billion years ago. It was spotted using the Hubble Space Telescope.
Earendel was made visible by an effect called gravitational lensing. That’s when gravity from a cluster of galaxies acts as a lens. This magnifies smaller objects in the background. 
The effect also helped scientists find the previous record holder, Icarus. That star formed more than 9 billion years ago. 
Earendel probably exploded a few million years after it formed. It took nearly 13 billion years for its light to reach us. In space terms, Earendel existed for just a brief time. That makes its discovery even more incredible, according to astronomer Brian Welch. “We definitely just got lucky,” he says.

On March 14, 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic forced 57th Street Books, in Chicago, Illinois, to close its doors. The store wouldn’t reopen for nearly a year and a half. During that time, director Jeff Deutsch was worried. Customers couldn’t come to the shop. They couldn’t browse the shelves. His main advantage over online retailers, such as Amazon, had vanished overnight.
 Deutsch says he and his team were lucky. Customers stepped up. They offered gifts and support. “There was something very beautiful in the way our community came together,” he told TIME for Kids. “[We] really supported one another’s institutions and businesses.”
Similar stories played out over the past two years in cities and towns around the country. Though independent bookstores were forced to close during the pandemic, many found ways to connect with and help their community.  

New Ideas
Before the pandemic, bookstores were already under financial pressure. Many had a hard time competing with Internet retailers because it’s so easy to buy books online. Then came COVID-19. It disrupted . It also caused labor shortages. In 2020, one in five independent bookstores in the United States was in danger of closing. 

That’s according to the American Booksellers Association (ABA). But many stores were able to turn things around with new ideas. Anne Holman is co-owner of the King’s English Bookshop. It’s in Salt Lake City, Utah. She says the store put books outside for browsing and “started doing a lot of events online.” Other stores set up bookselling hotlines, sold books out of vans, and improved their tools for .

The industry grew stronger. According to the ABA, 41 independent U.S. bookstores closed in 2021, but 215 new ones opened.
For the Community
Some bookstores organized events that went beyond bookselling. They offered COVID testing. They collected food for people in need. “Having an independent bookstore in your community is almost like a town square,” says Samira Ahmed, an author of books for young adults. “It’s an important place to build community.” 
One young fan of 57th Street Books is Adele Sorkin, 11. She’s on its Young Readers Advisory Board. Members receive early copies of books in exchange for writing reviews. “I think of the bookstore as a cookie jar,” Adele says. “It’s something special and fun that is always there for you.” Jeff Deutsch sees a bright future. “If we reimagine bookstores and make an effort to support [them],” he says, “then bookstores can thrive.”

Supporting Bookstores

There are many ways you can support your local bookstore. The first one is obvious. Buy books there! You can also support the store’s events. Is an author making an appearance there? Why not check it out? 
And spread the word. Recommend the store to a friend. “Young people are responsible for creating a society that values bookstores and a shared love of literature,” Jeff Deutsch says.

6,6,Should Schools Have Mental Health Days?,{'Debate'},"
In December, United States Surgeon General Vivek Murthy put out an urgent health advisory. He warned that children’s mental health was in crisis. He asked for help from many different sources, including schools. 
Schools help protect kids’ mental health in many ways. Some states let kids take mental health days. In August 2021, the New York Times reported that in the previous two years, eight states had passed bills allowing kids to stay home for “mental or behavioral health reasons.” 
Should schools offer mental health days? Some students say yes. They’re advocating for time off school so they can rest, recharge, and tend to their mental well-being. Other kids say no. They worry that students will take advantage of the offer, or be negatively affected by taking time off.
We asked TIME for Kids readers to weigh in on this important issue. Here’s what six of you had to say. 

Bibi van Tooren, 11
San Diego, California
Schools should give kids days off for mental health, because mental health is an important part of overall health. In fact, it is just as important as physical health. If you don’t feel 100%, it will have a big impact on your ability to focus. Kids get stressed with long school days, and school can cause a lot of anxiety and tension. Plus, kids don’t have much experience dealing with mental health crises.

Nugg Canales, 8
York, Pennsylvania
Kids should get mental health days off from school. Sometimes, we need to stay home and play games to calm our minds. Some schools don’t allow music, and I have days where I need calming music to make me feel good about me and the world. If you take a mental health day, you should not have to make up work because it adds stress to your life.

Sofia Ascencio, 10
Los Angeles, California
Schools should give kids days off for mental health. A lot of students have felt a difference in their mental health since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, when they were away from friends and family. Now that they are back in school, many students have developed feelings of depression, stress, and anxiety because of the load of homework and schoolwork that’s being put on them. Mental health days would help students reset, relax, and refresh. Then they would be able to come back to school ready to learn. 

Hailey Young, 12
Secane, Pennsylvania
The weekend was created to give us time off, but people don’t take advantage of those 48 hours. We children need to learn to better manage our time. We barely get our schoolwork done in the five work days we get. Plus, schools would need students to make up mental health days. They would probably do so during our real breaks: summer, winter, or spring. Another thing is that, for some kids, school might be their safe haven. Home might be scary or stressful for them. A mental health day might end up being more stressful than school. 

Jeremin Roy Itticheria, 10
Des Plaines, Illinois
Stress is increasing in kids because of the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change, and pollution. A report by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that between March and October 2020, there was a 24% increase in the number of mental health emergency-room visits by kids ages 5 to 11. Stress is on the rise for kids today. Mental health days would give kids a break and a chance to make up their schoolwork without being penalized for taking time off. And they might have time to get the professional help they need.

Johnny Gabel, 9
St. Louis, Missouri
I don’t think schools should give students days off for their mental health. Having too many days off can affect grades. And many people’s parents have to go to work. If students get too many days off, they might get left home too much. This could make some people’s mental health issues worse. I know some kids have serious mental health challenges. Those students could take breaks between subjects. There could also be services to improve their mental health and help them in school.

TFK Kid Reporter Lucy Sandor talks with Idris Elba, one of the stars of Paramount’s new movie Sonic the Hedgehog 2.
Sonic the Hedgehog is back. In this second movie based on the Sega video game, the blue hedgehog is still trying to prove he’s a hero. His chance arrives with the return of his archnemesis, Dr. Ivo Robotnik. This time, the mustached mad scientist has a new partner. Knuckles is the last of an extinct warrior tribe. He’s searching for an all-powerful emerald that can destroy civilization. It’s up to Sonic to stop the mischievous duo. 
Knuckles is voiced by the actor Idris Elba. He says doing the voice for an animated character was a challenge, at first. “I had to get used to the idea that no one is going to see my face,” Elba says. “I’m acting really hard, and no one’s looking. It’s just my voice.” 
But Elba was more than happy to be offered the role. When his agent called him about a new Sonic movie, Elba said, “I’ll do it.” 
“You haven’t heard the role,” his agent said. 
“Whatever it is, I’ll do it,” Elba said. He was a big fan of the video game. And he thought the first movie was “incredible.”
Knuckles is a fierce warrior. In Sonic 2, he’s willing to destroy anything that stands between him and the emerald—including Sonic. But as the movie progresses, we get to see another side of him. 
“Like you, I discovered that Knuckles wasn’t a bad guy,” Elba says. “He didn’t have bad intentions, really, even though he came out with knuckles blazing. He has a really warm, fuzzy, and cuddly side. And he’s proud of his tribe. That’s what drives him.”
Sonic the Hedgehog 2 also stars Jim Carrey, as Dr. Robotnik. The movie is now playing in theaters.

8,8,U.N. Climate Report,"{'Environment', 'World'}","
On April 4, the United Nations (U.N.) released a new report. Climate scientists say countries must reduce their fossil-fuel emissions sharply and soon. Otherwise, the dangers of global warming—such as droughts, wildfires, and ecosystem loss—will become worse.
António Guterres is the U.N. Secretary-General. He says the planet is facing “a climate emergency.”
In 2015, world governments promised to cut emissions. This was to keep global warming to just below 3°F. But many countries have not met their goal. Soon, it will be much harder to keep global warming under control.
But there’s hope. The report says technology for renewable energy, such as solar and wind power, has gotten better, and cheaper. Experts say wealthy countries could help poor nations move toward clean energy.
James Skea helps lead the group that released the report. He says the scientists are sending a message: “Human activities got us into this problem, and human agency can actually get us out of it again.”

It’s a drizzly December morning in Helsinki, Finland. At a center where students are running an imaginary town, one is in charge of the electric company. Another is interviewing the mayor. Minh Anh Ho, 11, is hunched over a microscope. She’s a researcher for a company that repurposes plastic. She’s analyzing cling wrap. “It’s a really important job,” she says. “Plastic takes a really long time to disappear, so it would be good to come up with something else to do with it and not just throw it away.”

The program teaches kids about work and business. But as Minh Anh’s “job” makes clear, it also teaches them about the circular economy.

The Circular Economy
Most societies have  economies. They operate on a “take, make, waste” model. This is when natural resources are taken from the Earth and made into products. Anything leftover is usually thrown away. 
In 2016, Finland became the first country to adopt a “road map” to a circular economy. This model focuses on the transformation of existing products. Businesses rely on recycled or repurposed materials. That cuts the amount of waste going into landfills.
“People think it’s just about recycling,” Nani Pajunen says. She’s a sustainability expert. “But really, it’s about rethinking everything—products, material development, how we consume.” 
Education has always been an important part of Finland’s plan. Pajunen says the key to changing a society is getting people to understand the need for a circular economy and how they can be part of it. 
Important Lessons 

Liisa Woitsch is sitting on the floor with kindergarten students and a broken chair. “Do we just throw it away now?” she asks. “Or can you think of anything else that can be done with it?” One boy says it can be used as a drum.  
Anssi Almgren helped design the curriculum. “Children have so many great ideas,” he says. “We wanted to enable them to think about solutions.” 
But it takes time to change a society by educating its youth. Tina Harms had never heard the term “circular economy.” Her daughter Karin, 19, says she has heard it “practically all my life.” Karin persuaded her family to work harder at recycling.  At first, Tina thought it was inconvenient. 
She feels differently now. “I think that if you have a teenager with very strong feelings about something,” Tina says, “it’s very demotivating if we older ones don’t show that we’re ready to make the extra effort to change.”
Good as New

Swappie is a company in Finland that  iPhones. It handles every step of the process. It receives the used phones, repairs them, and sends them out in working condition. 
The company has asked customers why they buy Swappies. Many say it’s because of the guaranteed quality and lower price. 
But some customers have another reason. It’s the company’s sense of purpose. They say this has made owning a Swappie cooler than getting a new phone.

According to the World Economic Forum, only 14% of plastic packaging is collected for recycling. Most is burned, tossed into a landfill, or scattered around the natural environment.
Experts say companies should do away with single-use containers. They could replace those with metal or glass containers that can be used over and over again.
“Recycling our way out of [the climate crisis] will not work,” Sander Defruyt says. He works at the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. “Reuse . . . will also have to be a crucial part of the solution.”

A Growing Market 
Loop is one company experimenting with reusable packaging. It sells food and household goods in Fred Meyer superstores. Soon it will expand to Walgreen’s drugstores.
  Other companies have tried to be less wasteful, too. As of 2019, less than 2% of their plastic packaging was reusable, Defruyt says. So this packaging’s effect is still minor.
 But the circular-economy movement has been gaining steam. (See “No More Trash.”) In the United States, the reusable-packaging market for beauty and personal-care products grew by about 65% from June 2020 to May 2021. The company Unilever has promised to cut its use of new plastic in half within the next few years.

Making It Work 
Can reusable packaging help us save the planet? Shelie Miller is a professor at the University of Michigan. She says any reusable item has a “payback” period. That’s the number of times it must be reused before it’s better for the environment than the single-use alternative. Think about reusable sandwich wrap. Making it and washing it take energy and resources. Those far  what goes into making disposable bags. It probably wouldn’t pay off. But reusable bottles could pay off, Miller says.
What consumers do also matters. Say someone buys a metal shampoo bottle and, instead of refilling it, gets lazy and tosses it in the garbage. That might be worse for the environment than a single-use bottle. This is because it took more energy to make the metal bottle.
Experts say reuse programs should be simple. Loop used to sell its products online. Customers sent empty containers back for a refill. Then the company switched to stores. Now customers can refill their bottles in person.
Tom Szaky founded TerraCycle, Loop’s parent company. He says this new system will make returns even easier. “If you’re already going to walk” to a store, he asks, “what’s the big deal in taking some empties?” 
Show Your Mug
Starbucks cafés use about 7 billion disposable cups a year. With the lids, that’s about 40% of the company’s total packaging waste. 

Now Starbucks is looking to phase out those cups. By 2025, the company plans to have borrow-a-cup programs in place. One possible plan involves customers paying a deposit for each reusable cup. When they’re done, they can return the cup to the store. —By Brian S. McGrath

13,13,"José Andrés, Space Chef?","{'World', 'Space'}","
Have you ever imagined eating a meal cooked by one of the world’s top chefs? Now imagine eating that meal in space! José Andrés is already a globally known chef, humanitarian, and New York Times best-selling author. Now, he’s adding another profession to that list: he’s creating traditional Spanish paella for space travel. His meals will feed the astronauts on Axiom Space’s Ax-1 mission, the first all-private crew mission to the International Space Station.
In March, I had a chance to speak with Chef Andrés. We talked about what it’s like to create food for astronauts. Andrés is someone who wants to make connections with all types of people, and that involves creativity and imagination. It was inspiring to hear about his work. And he was funny! And encouraging: He motivates young people to work hard, dream big, and believe in themselves.
Read part of our conversation below.

TFK Kid Reporter Orlie Weitzman:
Hello, Chef Andrés! I'm really happy to be here with you. 
I know that you are an internationally recognized chef, a humanitarian, a New York Times best-selling author, and a TV personality. And now, you’re devising culinary surprises for space travel. That's really cool. What sparked your interest in cooking? And how did you become a professional chef?
José Andrés:
My love for cooking was something that happened very early in my life, slowly but surely. I don't think I work as a cook. I think I enjoy being a cook, and it happens that it has become my profession. 
My mother and my father were very important [to my development as a cook]. I don't have a lot of memories of going to restaurants when I was growing up. Going to a restaurant was expensive, and my mom and my dad were working-class, a middle-class family. I remember I would go for bread every day. I would get my bike, and I would go to the bakery, and I’d pick up the bread, warm out of the oven. Or I would go with my mom to buy fruit, or I would go with my father to buy fish. 
I have three brothers, and we would always help in the kitchen: setting the table, bringing the dishes to the dishwasher, helping my mom. We got to love cooking because cooking was a good moment of being together. I only have fun memories of those moments. 
Orlie:
So it was your parents who helped spark that interest?
Andrés:
Yes, very much. Then, as I grew up, I began learning about chefs doing very cool things. I was 15 or 16 when I began working in the summer in a seafood restaurant up north of Barcelona, on the Mediterranean seacoast. For some reason, I found myself one summer in charge of the kitchen. Not because I was prepared to be the chef, but because the other chef left. And when there’s nobody around, what do you do? Well, you can do two things. You can quit, but then nothing happens. Or you can say, “Let me take care of it. Let me see if I can do it.” 
Orlie:
I understand that you are collaborating with Axiom Space, and that came about because of your friendship with the commander of the Ax-1 crew, Michael López-Alegría. How did you decide to work together?
Andrés:
I love science fiction, and I always had dreams of what it would be like cooking for a faraway planet. I love to look at the stars. I have my own telescope, and I love to watch the [International] Space Station when it passes every night through the sky. 
And so I began talking to some folks at NASA many years ago. They came to my office, they saw my laboratory, but nothing really happened for different reasons. That was fine. I showed them how I work, they showed me how they work. It was fun. Sometimes, when you meet people from other fields, it’s very good. Chefs should meet astronauts and astronauts should be chefs. Architects should meet doctors and doctors should meet painters, because when we open our connections to the world, we become more creative. We need to make sure that the different fields talk to [one another], because then we can achieve much more.
So López-Alegría is a friend. I met him many years ago. I think at one moment, he was an ambassador of foods from Spain. For me, it was funny that an astronaut was an ambassador of foods from Spain. When he got back to work as an astronaut and at Axiom, he called me and said, “Are you up for this?” And I’m like, “Okay, let me think about it. Um, yes!” 
Who would have said that a guy who left school fairly young, who only graduated three or four years ago—because my school finally gave me my diploma—would be putting a dish into space? This is very cool. And this is a big lesson for all of us: It doesn’t matter how impossible the dream is. If you work hard, maybe the dream is not as impossible as you think. 

Orlie:
What are some of the challenges in recreating traditional Spanish dishes for astronauts? Did you have to make any compromises or changes from the original ingredients to make the food fit for space travel?
Andrés:
Yes. When you need to feed people so far away from the surface of Planet Earth, food safety is the most important. You need to make sure that nobody will get sick because something happens with the food, or that the food is not going to spill oil over the entire space station. Those are things that NASA has done a very good job of over the years. Obviously, the astronauts have been eating, without my help, since people began going up into space. 
But for me, it was like, “Let me push the boundaries a little bit.” Everybody thinks about the freeze-dried food that goes up in space, and they put in water and rehydrate it. And this has been the way it’s been done. But for me, it was like, “Let me do it in a way that it’s a dish that is cooked, like if I was to cook it in my own restaurant, my own kitchen, my own home.” So we didn’t need to reinvent the wheel. We only had to learn from what they’ve been doing already for all these years. Take that knowledge, then bring what we wanted to do, and start understanding how some boundaries actually became opportunities. 
For us, it was, “Do we cook the rice before and then put it in the bags?” But then those bags, they need to be put under very high pressure, high temperature to make sure that all bacteria will be killed and that the health of the astronaut will not be compromised. But if the food is already cooked and you put that in the bag, and then that bag goes under a lot of pressure, it’s going to become like mush. Paella Valenciana cannot allow rice to become mushy and like a porridge. And that was a challenge. 

So what we did was, we put the rice in the bag raw. We found the right proportions of liquid with the right density of oil, and we closed the bag and cooked it under the pressure and the heat. Rice is like a sponge: It absorbs liquid and expands. When the liquid is dense enough, the absorption happens more slowly, which is a good thing. And after a lot of trial and error, we got the right proportion to make a rice that looks like a rice you would make in a kitchen. In the end, we were very happy with the result. 
I already know the astronauts and [López-Alegría] have tested the rice and they love it. Now we need to make sure that they love it once they are up in the space station. 
Orlie:
Do you ever want to go to space yourself and cook there?
Andrés:
My friend, if they give me the opportunity to go to space, I won’t waste a second.

We celebrate Earth Day each year on April 22. It’s a day to do the planet some good. But many people work hard year-round to protect the Earth, including young people like you. Read about these incredible Kid Heroes for the Planet. We hope they inspire you to pitch in for Planet Earth.
Busy Bees

There’s a lot of buzz in Kenansville, North Carolina. That’s because of the Duplin County Royal Court 4-H Club. Its nine kid beekeepers are learning about bees and how to save them.
“A bee visits about 2,000 flowers a day,” club leader Leslie Gosnell told TIME for Kids. With beekeeping, “you’re helping with the pollination of everything around you.”
Yohsiah Crews, 9, is a beekeeper. At first, he was afraid of being stung. “But not now,” he says. His favorite thing about working with bees? “I like eating the fresh honey.” 
His sister, Arabella, 15, is also in the club. “Honeybees are super important,” she says, “because they will pollinate a lot of crops that other pollinators don’t.”

A Smart Sprinkler

When Adarsh Ambati was in sixth grade, he noticed something odd. The frogs in the creek near his house quit croaking, and green lawns were turning brown. He knew his hometown of San Jose, California, was going through a drought. But it was the first time he’d seen these effects. His family conserved water. But some of his neighbors forgot to turn off their sprinklers, so water was wasted. 
This inspired Adarsh to create a smart sprinkler system. It senses moisture levels in soil. It uses real-time weather data to detect when sprinklers should be turned on. 
Now 17, Adarsh is the founder of the Green Environment Initiatives. He has some advice for kids who want to fix big problems. “Stay focused,” he says. “Then think of ways to engineer solutions.”

Ride On!

Nora Ball (right) was nearly hit by a car at the intersection in front of her school. Three years earlier, a student lost her life at that same spot. Nora decided to do something. She teamed up with Bria Brown (left) to speak at City Hall, in Atlanta, Georgia. They argued that the intersection not only endangers students, it threatens the Earth. 
Nora and Bria went on to cofound Atlanta Students Advocating for Pedestrians (ASAP). One of the group’s goals is to help the Earth and the community by making it easier to travel by bike. In 2019, the organization received an award from the Atlanta Bicycle Coalition.
Nora, 17, explains that every gallon of gasoline produces about 20 pounds of carbon dioxide (CO2). This greenhouse gas can cause respiratory problems. It also contributes to global warming. Nora says biking and walking, instead of driving, can help reduce greenhouse gases. Plus, she says, biking is “a good way to exercise and to appreciate the beauty of the Earth!”  

Coding for Change

Hailey Van is passionate about environmental science. The 14-year-old is from Irvine, California. She has used coding to model carbon-dioxide conditions. That helped her understand carbon dioxide’s effects on our oceans. She studied ocean acidification. And she studied hypoxia, a dangerous low-oxygen condition. For her work, Hailey received the 2021 Broadcom Coding with Commitment Award. 
“The ocean affects so much of our environment,” Hailey says. “It regulates temperature. It regulates climate patterns. So we need to spread awareness about it.” Hailey is working on publishing her research. She offers this tip for young problem-solvers: “Conduct as much research as you can. Then find ways that you can help fight for that issue.”

Sailor and ocean advocate Charlie Enright cares about the environment. He competes in the Ocean Race to raise awareness about the seas. Here, he speaks with TFK Kid Reporter Cash Daniels, who also cares about the environment. Cash’s work fighting plastic pollution made him a Kid of the Year Top Five honoree. 
 You sail with the 11th Hour Racing Team. What does that name mean?
The 11th hour is supposed to signify where this planet is in its life. If we don’t make some substantial changes in the 11th hour, particularly regarding ocean health, we’re going to be in big trouble. So we’re trying to create a sense of urgency around the global climate situation and empower people to act.
I read about your new boat. The solar panels and hydrogenerator are amazing. What other sustainable features does this boat have?
One of the big things we’re proud of is the use of alternative materials. Right now, the best material for building a race boat is carbon fiber. We’ve been working with a couple of people who created recycled carbon fiber, which has 90% less [carbon] footprint. And we use a lot of flax and bamboo.

 
 
What are the most challenging waters to sail in? 
I’d say the Southern Ocean, for sure. There are big waves, cold temperatures, and a lot of wind. That’s definitely the most physically demanding. But sometimes, the doldrums, around the equator, where there’s not a lot of wind, can be just as mentally taxing.

 
As a sailor who spends a lot of time out on the oceans, what effects of climate change have you seen?
It’s tough to quantify. But I think whether you’re on the oceans or living your daily life on land, the weather patterns have become a lot more erratic. Growing up here in Rhode Island, we’ve always had a sea breeze. As a general observation of mine, it’s just different from how it used to be. When we race around the planet, we have ice gates in the Southern Ocean around Antarctica, so we don’t get too close to the ice. Those gates are constantly creeping further north, which I think speaks to the ice flow and the melting.
Have you seen animal species migrating in or to places that you haven’t seen them previously?
It’s tough to observe that firsthand. But I do a lot of reading on this, and I work with a lot of organizations that study this. With the changing ocean temperatures, it’s something that we’ve got to look out for. 

 
With regard to plastic pollution, what’s the most common thing you’ve seen?
The scary thing out there is what you can’t see. Microplastics aren’t visible with the human eye. We have a sampler on board that collects water and tests for microplastics, so we know they’re out there. The things that you can see are tons of water bottles and cigarettes. Those are probably the two big ones.
What’s one of the most important lessons that sailing has taught you?
The size of the Earth should not be underestimated. It’s funny: Sailing around it sometimes makes me feel like it’s so small. But other times when you’re out there, it’s just so vast. The ocean is so powerful, and you learn never to take it for granted. I’m lucky to be able to do what I do and to pursue my passion as my profession.

16,16,Into the Wild,"{'Environment', 'Movies and Television'}","
Our Great National Parks is a new series on Netflix. Narrator Barack Obama introduces viewers to the natural beauty—and incredible animals—of parks around the world. “This is a series that celebrates the greatest conservation success story of the past century,” executive producer James Honeyborne told TIME for Kids. He and series producer Sophie Todd spoke to TFK Kid Reporter David Murtagh about images from the show. Here’s what they had to say.

LEAPING LEMURS Sifaka lemurs live among the jagged rock formations of Tsingy de Bemaraha park, in Madagascar. “They have a sort of natural protection in this fortress of rocks,” Todd says. For a month, the crew followed a lemur family around these rocks. It’s “unlike anything you’ve ever seen,” she says. Honeyborne agrees: “There’s a huge drop that the lemurs have to leap across. They’re amazing. They’re like the ultimate  athletes.”

HAPPY HIPPO “Hippopotamuses are incredible animals,” Todd says. “We filmed them using a special underwater camera” at Tsavo National Park, in Kenya. “One of the things we get to see in the series is that they open their mouths when they want to go to the dentist. Then the fish come in and clean all between their teeth.” The fish also nibble on the animals’ feet and backs to get rid of . For the hippos, Todd says, “it’s like having a spa day.”

FEED ME! Rakus the Orangutan lives in Gunung Leuser park, in Indonesia. “Rakus means ‘greedy,’” Todd says. “He’s called Greedy because he eats everything. He eats termites. He eats leaves. One of his favorite foods is a fruit called neesia. It’s about the size of a football. It’s very hard to get the seeds out. He’ll peel a stick and use it as a tool to pick out his favorite bits.” Honeyborne adds: “The fruit is full of sharp hairs. If he gets a mouthful of the hairs, it’s like eating cactus. It’s not so good.”

SWARMING THE SEA These sea nettle jellyfish were spotted at the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary, in California. “Come fall, they can swarm in vast numbers,” Honeyborne says. “The seas are very rich and full of nutrients and full of microscopic plants and animals that they will eat. They are a sign that the seas have reached the richness that they do at the end of summer. It’s a sign that the great gathering of creatures is heading toward Monterey.”

FAMILY MATTERS “Pumas were always felt to be solitary animals,” Todd says. “But in Patagonia, in Chile, there are now more and more pumas because the land is protected and there’s more of their prey.” This female puma has three cubs. (Only one is visible here.) “They were very hungry,” Honeyborne says. “So she had to go hunting. She tries her very, very best and struggles to get food for her babies. She’s a devoted mom.”

17,17,The Ripple Effect,"{'Young Game Changers', 'World'}","
Sagarika Sriram was 10 years old when she started reading newspaper stories. They were about a planet in trouble. One story was about turtles. They had plastic in their stomachs. Sagarika knew she needed to do something. First, she joined a group. It organized cleanup campaigns in Dubai. That’s her home city. It’s in the United Arab Emirates. The group “helped me understand what an individual can do and how I can really make a difference,” she says.


 
Then Sagarika created Kids for a Better World. It’s a digital platform. It has brought together nearly 10,000 youths. They come from all over the world. Their goal is to fight climate change.
Thinking Big
Sagarika is now 16. She’s part of a growing number of young climate activists. “We’re the generation that is going to face the consequences if the climate crisis is not tackled,” she says. She believes even individual actions can create a “ripple effect.” Sagarika says this can build . It can move things in the right direction. 

 Kids for a Better World is for people ages 8 to 16. It teaches them about what they can do to reverse climate change. They can grow food or plant trees. They can collect recyclables .They can avoid using plastic bags. “This is the information which can help change our future,” Sagarika says.  
Inspiring Action
Dubai is a desert . Growing up there has made Sagarika very aware of the need for action. Her city faces the risk of rising temperatures. Its water supply is shrinking. She believes young people can bring attention to these environmental challenges. 

 
Sagarika is all about small actions. But she has big plans. She’d like to go to college in California. While she’s there, she’ll continue being an activist. She’ll also be running Kids for a Better World. She hopes to inspire others to fight for a greener planet. Others have inspired her. “We’re creating our own system of inspirational change-makers,” she says.

During the pandemic, my family started a backyard garden. We also began composting food scraps. I was surprised at how easy it is. And it’s so much better for the environment to compost instead of putting food scraps in the trash. I learned that up to 40% of food produced each year in the United States is thrown out. This wastes resources that went into producing food in the first place! 
My brother and I have been working to persuade everyone to compost. We took the idea to our school and asked our principal if we could start a compost program there. Our school loved the idea! We call it the Compost Challenge. It will start next school year. What began as one family’s project has turned into a community effort.

Genesis Butler is 15. She has been vegan since she was 6. Her goal is to protect animals and the environment. She hopes to inspire other kids to join this effort. TFK Kid Reporter Via Ryerson spoke to Genesis to learn more. 
1. At age 10, you were one of the youngest TEDx speakers ever. What were you trying to accomplish in that speech?
When I first became a , I knew animals were being harmed to produce our food. Then I found out how eating animals was also harming our planet. I wanted more people to know that their choices can affect everyone’s future.
2. What are the benefits of going vegan? 
A lot of land and water go into raising animals. By not eating animals, you’re saving those resources. 
3. What would you tell someone who didn’t want to go vegan but still wanted to help the planet? 
If you can’t go fully vegan, you can still change some of your food choices. For one day, instead of meat or dairy, you can try a plant-based option. There are so many to choose from.
4. Why are kids so important in the fight against climate change?
It’s important that kids speak up. It shows they’re really worried about their future. We need a planet to live on. So we need to do whatever we can to stop climate change. 
5. You founded Youth Climate Save. Can you talk a little about that?
A lot of young people are thinking, “What can I do about climate change?” I started Youth Climate Save because I knew there were kids who needed support to become activists. 
6. You also founded a nonprofit, Genesis for Animals. What does this group do? 
Genesis for Animals raises money for . There are so many activists working to free animals from factory farms. Once the animals are free, they need a place to go. The money helps keep the sanctuaries going. 
7. What’s the most important lesson you’ve learned from being an activist?
I learned that it’s important to do self-care. Make sure you’re helping yourself as much as you’re trying to help the planet or help others.  
8. You’re only 15. What are you planning to do next? 
When I get older, I want to run my own animal sanctuary. I also want to become a veterinarian.

20,20,Food for All,"{'People', 'World'}","
Massimo Bottura opened a restaurant in Italy 27 years ago. It has been named the best in the world, twice. Today, Bottura leads a  empire. It extends from Dubai, in the Middle East, to Beverly Hills, California. 
But of all the things he’s done, Bottura says his greatest achievement is Refettorio Ambrosiano. It’s also in Italy. Twelve global spin-offs have followed.

At Refettorio Ambrosiano, the menu changes daily. It depends on what comes with the morning delivery. One day, the delivery contains chicken close to its sell-by date. There are oranges too ugly for the grocery store. By dinner, these supermarket castoffs have been transformed. About 100 people enjoy the meal. They include refugees, the homeless, and the unemployed. For an hour, they can forget about life’s challenges. 

Bottura’s Refettorios are not restaurants. They are soup kitchens. Not that Bottura would call them that. He thinks of them as places that shine a light on the dignity of their guests while focusing attention on the food-waste problem. 
Creating a Movement 

Bottura came up with the idea of Refettorio Ambrosiano in 2015. Organizers of the World Expo, in Italy, had invited him to cook for its grand opening. Bottura said he wanted to do something different. He wanted to cook for the homeless, using surplus food. Pope Francis heard about this. He helped arrange the use of a theater in a run-down neighborhood. Bottura turned it into a dining room for people in need. 
Today, his Refettorios are “a movement,” Bottura says. “We treat our guests like we do at our restaurants. That’s the warm hug we are giving. We are saying, ‘Welcome, this is a beautiful place, and it’s your place. This is the food that we cook for you. We are here for you.’”  
Making a Difference 
At a refettorio, a chef must make whole meals out of surplus. And at Bottura’s restaurants, the cooks squeeze maximum use out of every ingredient, including vegetable peelings and stale bread. 

Turning basic ingredients into  gold is Bottura’s magic. He says his grandmother taught him how. “What you think is food waste is just an opportunity to create something amazing,” he says.
Chefs at Bottura’s restaurants learn his approach to cooking, but they also learn about his commitment to making a difference in people’s lives. “Everybody has the ability to contribute to positive change. It starts with all of us, in our own kitchens,” Bottura says.
The Food-Waste Problem

“We are 8 billion people on Earth. We produce enough food for 12 billion people,” chef Massimo Bottura says. “Yet 820 million people don’t have enough to eat.”
Every year, more than a billion tons of food ends up wasted. And food waste is responsible for 10% of global greenhouse emissions.

The historic remains of the ship Endurance have been found nearly 10,000 feet beneath the Weddell Sea, in Antarctica. Explorer Ernest Shackleton led the ship’s 1914 expedition. Endurance set sail from England and got stuck in Antarctic ice. It was eventually crushed by the ice. The ship sank on November 21, 1915. The whole crew survived. 
“This is by far the finest wooden shipwreck I have ever seen,” Mensun Bound says. He’s a director of the Endurance22 expedition, which announced the discovery on March 9. Bound says the ship is “in a brilliant state of preservation.”
Researchers used underwater drones to search the sea where Endurance sank. It took more than two weeks. The ship is a historic monument, so there are no plans to raise it.

Gasoline prices continue to rise. On March 13, the average cost of a gallon of regular gas in the United States was $4.43. That’s $1.54 higher than it was a year ago.
“It’s very expensive, high for people who are earning the minimum,” Julian Mesa says. He recently paid $5.79 a gallon in California.
Prices at the pump have been going up for months. Pandemic restrictions are lifting. More people are on the road. This has increased demand for oil, which is used to make gasoline.
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has made things worse. In order to punish Russia, many countries have put sanctions in place there. It’s now harder for Russia to sell its oil. This will make the global shortage worse, driving prices up.
By one estimate, U.S. families could pay $2,000 more for gas this year. “A lot of people have little choice,” economist Paul Ashworth told the New York Times. “They have to drive.”

24,24,TFK Kid Report: Honoring a Legend,"{'Sports', 'History'}","
This year marks the 75th anniversary of Jackie Robinson’s historic debut in Major League Baseball. You can read about his life in the story “Honoring a Legend,” in this week’s issue of TIME for Kids. Here, Zyimauri Byars, 9, writes about a recent school project, in which he learned about Robinson's legacy.

I’m in the third grade at American Dreamer STEM Academy, in Decatur, Illinois. My class recently staged a living-history museum to celebrate Black History Month. I chose to portray Jackie Robinson, because I love baseball. A school volunteer helped me get my outfit together­: a baseball cap, jersey, and pants. I borrowed a bat and glove. The bat was similar to one Robinson used. I was a little nervous to portray Robinson, at first. Then I remembered how brave he was, and that helped me. I learned that Jackie Robinson was one of five children. He was the first African American to play modern Major League Baseball. He played for the Brooklyn Dodgers. I admire Robinson, because he showed people that it’s not your skin color that matters. It’s how you play the game.

26,26,Honoring a Legend,{'Sports'},"
On April 15, 1947, Jackie Robinson became the first Black athlete to play modern Major League Baseball (MLB). Until then, most Black players were restricted to separate leagues.
When Robinson took the field for the Brooklyn Dodgers, in New York City, he broke professional baseball’s “color line.” The term refers to the social and legal barriers that denied equal rights to Black people in the United States. Robinson was taking a big step, not just in the history of sports but in the history of American civil rights. Every year on April 15, MLB honors his .
“He represents all of us,” says Francisco Lindor of the New York Mets. “Not just the Black community, but the Hispanic community, the Asian community, everybody. He opened the doors for all of us.”

The Natural
Jack Roosevelt Robinson was born in Cairo, Georgia, on January 31, 1919. He was always good at sports. At the University of California, Los Angeles, he was a star on the basketball, football, and track teams. 
After college, he started his athletic career in football, in 1941. He played for  teams in Hawaii and, later, in Los Angeles. 
But baseball called. In 1945, Robinson joined the Kansas City Monarchs, a Black team. He was a league all-star. That’s how the Dodgers discovered him. 
He was an instant MLB success. In 1947, he was named Rookie of the Year. Two years later, he was Most Valuable Player. He retired from baseball in 1957, and was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1962.

A Life's Work
Robinson’s contribution to civil rights didn’t end with baseball. In 1957, he became a vice president at Chock Full o’ Nuts, a major coffee company. He used his position to improve working conditions. He joined the NAACP, a civil rights organization, and he worked with Martin Luther King Jr. on integrating schools. He frequently took part in marches, and in the 1970s, he helped build low-income housing.

This year is the 75th anniversary of Robinson’s first major-league game. Over the years, he has been a role model to many people. “Jackie Robinson made my success possible,” King said, in 1968. “Without him, I would never have been able to do what I did.”

28,28,Six Flavors in One Book,"{'Books', 'Time Off'}","
The Ice Cream Machine is no ordinary tale. It’s six stories rolled into one flavorful book. They all have the same title. But each story has a very different plot revolving around ice cream.  
One ice-cream story focuses on a boy and his robot in the distant future. Another is about a girl and her father who invent an ice-cream machine. My favorite story in the book centers on two sisters, Pam and Penelope, who attempt to enter an ice-cream–eating contest. The six stories are accompanied by black-and-white illustrations by six different artists.
The Ice Cream Machine’s author, Adam Rubin, has experience writing about food. His most famous children’s book is Dragons Love Tacos. It was a best-seller. “I like to write about food because it’s universally beloved by people of all different cultures,” Rubin says. 
He hopes The Ice Cream Machine will inspire kids. Its jacket folds up into an envelope. Readers can use it to send Rubin their stories. He says people should write about what they like.  “If you’re trying to write something that someone else likes, you might not get it right,” he says. “But if you focus on writing about something that you like, then it’s fun.”
I recommend The Ice Cream Machine to anyone who likes creative storytelling. The book goes down just like ice cream: easy, enjoyable, and with a pleasant aftertaste.
As for Rubin’s favorite ice-cream flavor? “Chocolate chip,” he says. (Don’t tell him, but the best flavor is actually birthday cake!)

29,29,What is the Metaverse?,"{'Culture', 'Technology'}","
When Cathy Hackl’s son wanted a party for his ninth birthday, he didn’t ask for party favors or decorations. He asked if he could hold the celebration on Roblox, a digital platform where users can play and create games. He and his friends wouldn’t meet in person: Their virtual  would attend the party online.

“They hung out and played and they went to other different games together,” Hackl says. “Just because it happens in a virtual space doesn’t make it less real. It’s very real to my son.”
Roblox is part of the metaverse, a “place” parallel to the physical world. The term has lately entered the mainstream, as millions of people spend hours a day in virtual spaces like Roblox. Other kinds of virtual platforms are growing too, for things like video-based education and hybrid workplaces. For better or worse, we’re spending more of our lives in digital spaces.

Metawhat?
The word metaverse is often traced to a science-fiction book published in the 1990s. But the metaverse is far from the stuff of sci-fi. It’s not even new. Online communities have existed since the 1980s. Today, logging into Roblox, joining a chat with friends, and launching into a game with them is just as social an experience as most real-world interactions.

We enter the metaverse through virtual reality (VR) and  reality (AR), or simply on a screen. These experiences allow a greater blending of our digital and physical lives. But these two worlds are already interwoven, no headset required. Think about the Uber app. It uses location data to tell riders how far away the car is. Or think about how Netflix keeps track of what you’ve watched in order to make suggestions.
John Riccitiello has an idea of what the metaverse will look like in the future. He’s CEO of Unity Technologies, a company that makes software for video games. “You’ve got your goggles on, 10 years from now, but they’re just a pair of sunglasses that [has] the ability to bring you into the metaverse experience,” he says. “You’re walking by a restaurant, you look at it, the menu pops up. What your friends have said about it pops up.” The possibilities are endless.

The Vision
At its core, the metaverse is an expansion of the Internet. And there are plenty of Internet problems to solve already, such as hacking and cyberbullying. These suggest how challenging a future in the metaverse could be. 
But many people believe the metaverse has real benefits. Among other things, they say it can expand social networks and improve mental health. 
Hackl is a metaverse expert. She’s also Latina. As the technology develops, she sees opportunities for the metaverse to be more inclusive. “We need to see people like me in these public-facing roles,” she says. “You can inspire a lot more people to join and say, ‘Hey, I am welcome in this metaverse world. I can build.’” 
For those who are already spending part of their life in the metaverse, that building has begun. 
Reality Check

Carrie Tatsu runs a business in the metaverse. But she wants her kids to spend as much time as possible in the real world. “It’s so important for humans to be with humans in real life,” she says. “I think that as kids grow up in this space, there will have to be outlets for [them] to engage, go smell a flower here, walk on a trail, have a real conversation with [a] friend. . . . Even though you can simulate that, the simulation is not the same.”

On March 4, the Russian government passed a law. It makes reporting the facts about Russia’s invasion of Ukraine illegal. Several major news organizations have suspended broadcasting in Russia, including ABC and CNN. The Russian government says that their war coverage is fake. Journalists could face 15 years in prison. 
Tim Davie leads the BBC. That’s a British news outlet. Davie says staff safety is a concern. He doesn’t want BBC journalists to get in trouble “simply for doing their jobs.”  
Some Russian news outlets are run by the government. They’re not allowed to use the words invasion or war. And they don’t show what’s really happening in Ukraine. This has led many people in Russia to believe there is no war in Ukraine.
The Russian government has also limited access to social media outlets. These include Twitter and Facebook. They publish news in Russian.
Nick Clegg is president of global affairs at Meta. The company owns Facebook. Clegg says millions of Russians will be “cut off from reliable information” and “silenced from speaking out.”
The BBC is telling people in Russia to use apps or shortwave radio. They can listen to news reports from outside the country. “Access to accurate, independent information is a fundamental human right, which should not be denied to the people of Russia,” the BBC says. “We will continue our efforts to make BBC News available in Russia, and across the rest of the world.”

Evidence gathered by NASA’s Curiosity rover suggests there may have been life on the Red Planet. You can read about Curiosity's discoveries in the story “Life on Mars,” in this week’s issue of TIME for Kids. Nevaeh Abney recently had an opportunity to talk with NASA scientists about the Mars rover missions and writes about her experience below.

School isn’t always easy. But I know if I try my best to do something and don’t give up, I will get it. That’s called perseverance. I go to Madison Elementary in Massena, New York. We learned about NASA’s Mars missions. NASA has two active rovers on Mars: Curiosity and Perseverance. Recently, I won NASA’s You’ve Got Perseverance award. The Perseverance rover sent me a message from Mars! I was so happy! I got to talk with people on the Perseverance team at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Lab, in California. They told me about the rover’s many different parts. Perseverance wouldn’t be on Mars today if the team hadn’t worked hard and persevered for many years.

34,34,Life on Mars,{'Science'},"
Around 4 billion years ago, Mars had oceans and a thick blanket of air. These conditions could have supported life.
For nearly 10 years, NASA’s Curiosity rover has been exploring the planet’s Gale Crater. Long ago, the crater was probably a lake. Today, it contains rocks and . Curiosity has studied these for clues that tiny life-forms called microbes once lived there. In January, NASA announced that Curiosity might have found evidence that they did.
Tantalizing Clues
A newly published study looks at tests Curiosity has done on Martian rocks and soil. The rover found carbon 12. This chemical is linked with life on Earth. Nearly half of Curiosity’s samples contained high amounts of carbon 12. 

The scientists put forth a possible explanation. Long ago, microbes grew in Martian soil. Those microbes consumed and processed carbon. This produced methane gas. The gas rose into the atmosphere. It was broken down into carbon by sunlight. The carbon rained down. It settled on Mars as dust. 
Christopher House was the lead scientist on the study. He says Mars may have hosted life in the same way as Earth once did. “The Martian samples resemble Earth rocks from Australia” from more than 2½ billion years ago, he says. At that time, Earth’s atmosphere was rich in methane.
More Possibilities 
Curiosity’s findings are not . Paul Mahaffy is a retired member of the Curiosity science team. “We would really need more evidence to say we’ve identified life,” he says. 

Another explanation for the carbon could be a change in the Martian atmosphere. Energy from the sun could have made the carbon that rained down on the planet. Or a cloud full of carbon could have passed through the solar system and left some behind. “We are being cautious with our interpretations here,” House says. “But that is the right approach when studying another world, such as Mars.”

Shipwrecks. Buried treasure. King Tut’s tomb. Author Stefan Milosavljevich explores these topics and more in Tales of Ancient Worlds: Adventures in Archaeology. TFK Kid Reporter David Murtagh digs in.
For kids who might not have studied archaeology in school, what is it?  
Archaeology is the study of all the stuff we leave behind. If we’re trying to reconstruct history, we have two sources of information. One is the stuff that people wrote down. The other is all the stuff we make, or drop, even our own bodies, or the waste we get rid of.
What’s your favorite period of history?  
I do really love the Stone Age. I think it’s so interesting to go back to our earliest time.  
 What inspired you to write this book? 
 I wanted to share the biggest passion in my life. When I was your age, I was surrounded by history. You know King John from Robin Hood? He was buried in my hometown. Those sorts of things just always connected me with history. 
Have scientific advances changed how archaeologists work?  
Technology has changed archaeology so much. Now archaeologists can get a sample of dirt and test it for human DNA. When we test a tooth for human DNA, we actually destroy the tooth. That was our one shot at trying to understand the past. But with dirt, there’s loads of it. 
What advice do you have for kids interested in archaeology?

37,37,War in Ukraine,"{'Government', 'World'}","
Russian forces launched an attack on Ukraine. It happened on February 24. The next day, Russian troops got close to the country’s capital. The move came after weeks of troop buildup. The troops were along Ukraine’s borders.  
Volodymyr Zelenskyy is Ukraine’s president. He’s asking other countries for military aid. He’s also asking for sanctions against Russia. Sanctions are punishments. They can hurt a country’s economy.

 
Vladimir Putin is Russia’s president. World leaders have spoken out against him. They disapprove of his actions. The United States has sent military aid to Ukraine. It has put sanctions in place. Other countries have too. U.S. president Joe Biden called the attacks “unjustified.”

 
“This is a dangerous moment for all of Europe, for freedom around the world,” President Biden said on February 24.
Crisis in Context 
Ukraine is a country in Eastern Europe. It shares a long border with Russia. It’s home to nearly 44 million people. Ukraine was once part of the Soviet Union. So was Russia. Ukraine and Russia became separate countries in 1991. That was after the breakup of the Soviet Union. 
Putin claimed the attack was necessary. He said it was to protect people. These people are in two parts of eastern Ukraine. These regions are controlled by separatist groups. The groups want their regions to break away from Ukraine. 

 
Putin has also said the U.S. and its allies have ignored Russia’s demands. Russia says Ukraine must be stopped from aligning with these countries. Ukraine has hoped to join NATO. That’s the North Atlantic  Organization. It’s made up of 28 European countries. The U.S. and Canada are also part of it. And Ukraine has applied to join the European Union. It’s made up of 27 European countries. If Ukraine were part of these groups, it would get more support.
The U.S. says Russia’s claims are an excuse. It says Russia wants a wider invasion of Ukraine. “This was never about genuine security concerns,” Biden said. “It was always about . . . Putin’s desire for .”
The World Responds
 

Anti-war protests have taken place all over the world. That includes Russia. Thousands of Russians have taken to the streets. They are protesting their country’s decision to invade Ukraine. More than 1,700 people in Russia were detained by authorities. That was on February 24 alone. 
 

As of March 3, more than a million people had fled Ukraine. That’s according to the United Nations refugee agency. Aid groups are helping Ukrainians. 

 
World leaders continue to show support. Jens Stoltenberg is the NATO chief. He has called for the attacks to end. “We stand with . . . Ukraine during this terrible time,” he said.
Helping Hands

World Central Kitchen is helping people. It’s providing hot meals. The meals go to refugees at border crossings in Poland. One of the crossings is shown here. WKC is also working to feed people who are still in Ukraine.   
Chef José Andrés founded the group. That was in 2010. On February 27, he posted a video on social media. It was from the Poland-Ukraine border. “People are cold. . . . They carry with them whatever they can bring,” he said. “They have a smile, with hope, when the situation is so dire.”

43,43,Should Governments Regulate Screen Time?,"{'Debate', 'Opinion'}","
In fall 2021, the United States Senate held a hearing. It was about Facebook. Senators discussed whether it’s bad for children. Senator Dan Sullivan, of Alaska, said that national screen-time limits could protect kids. He mentioned something that happened in China last year.
On August 30, the Chinese government announced that kids would not be allowed to play online games Mondays to Thursdays. On most weekends and holidays, kids would be limited to an hour a day of online gaming. “Recently, many parents have reported that game addiction among some youths and children is seriously harming their normal study, life, and mental and physical health,” the Chinese government said online. 
This news and Senator Sullivan’s words got us thinking. Should a government be responsible for limiting how much time kids spend online? We asked TIME for Kids readers to share their opinion. Many of you wrote to us. Here’s where you stand.

Justin Lining, 10 
 Bellevue, Washington
Most people are obsessed with their phones and TVs. You can hurt your eyes and waste time by being addicted to screens. And watching a lot of TV or playing games can interfere with kids’ learning and social skills. If the government limited screen time, people would be encouraged to spend more quality time with their family. They might join a sports team in their neighborhood.

Esmé McNeely, 11
Tacoma, Washington
The government should not set screen-time limits. That decision should be up to parents or guardians. Some children need more screen time than others. Some children need to use screens for homework. And during quarantine, one of the only ways to talk to friends was online. Government limits would not be fair to people who are careful with their screen time. 

Jacie Lynch-Plaisted, 12
Elmira, New York 
The government should set screen-time limits. Kids can forget how to socialize. And they can neglect to take care of their mental health if they are staring at a screen for too long. 
Without screen-time limits, kids can sometimes stay up too late. Staying up too late can be bad. It can affect your sleeping schedule. Not getting enough sleep can make you feel really tired during the day. And feeling tired during the day can affect your performance in school. 

Lucas Barone, 11 
Washington, D.C.
The government should not limit screen time. A 2021 study from the University of Colorado Boulder says screen time might be less harmful to kids than people think. Some parents worry that children who are on screens too much won’t make friends. But the study reports that screen time can actually improve kids’ friendships. 
Screen time can be educational. It can help kids do good work. I use websites to read and to learn math. Kids can become healthier by using certain apps, too. For example, you can learn how to do yoga from screens!
 

Xiuhan Zhu, 9
Hopkinton, Massachusetts
I think the government should take action and limit screen time for kids. Too much screen time can lead to exhaustion and a decrease in socialization. Plus, smartphones are distracting. People who use them are more likely to trip or get into car accidents. 
Devices like computers can also be harmful for kids. If kids aren’t careful with the websites they use, criminals can get access to important information. 
Instead of keeping busy on the screen, try doing something fun and creative. Try making origami, reading books, playing sports, or tinkering with Legos. 

Belem Gaeta Cuara, 10
Hudson, Colorado
The government should not set screen limits for a few reasons. First, kids need time to unwind after school. They should have as much time on screens as they want. I work hard all day. Looking at a screen when I get home helps me settle down. 
Second, kids should have the right to talk with friends online and play their favorite games. Friendships are very important. Playing a game with your buddy can put a smile on your face. 
Third, screens help kids learn and develop their knowledge.
 

Akshay Shah, 9
Scotch Plains Township, New Jersey
Spending too much time looking at screens can lead to poor grades, strain on the eyes, and loss of sleep. According to a national survey done by the Kaiser Family Foundation, children ages 8 to 18 years old spend an average of seven hours and 38 minutes on entertainment media on most days. And that data was published in 2010! About half of the students reported to be heavy media users got low or fair grades in school. With screen-time limits, kids would have more time to go outside, exercise, read a book, or play a game.

“Red Panda is just Mei times 100,” Rosalie says. She was Mei’s age when she voiced the role. “The panda embodies Mei’s insecurities and fears.”
Asian people in films are often shown as examples of success. Sometimes, they are superheroes. Rosalie says this puts pressure on Asian viewers. They may feel they have to live up to idealized expectations.
Embrace your insecurities. For Rosalie, that’s the message to take away from Mei’s adventures. “All these insecurities, these differences, are what make people who they are,” Rosalie says. “Find out who you are, not what other people want you to be.”

After coming home from the 2018 Winter Olympics, in South Korea, Chloe Kim put her gold medal in the trash. (It didn’t stay there long.) Kim was struggling. She was a new celebrity. She had become the youngest female Olympic gold medalist in snowboarding history. She was 17.
Kim was also feeling depressed. This is common for Olympic athletes. They train hard for events that come only every four years. Kim says the feeling hit her shortly after the 2018 Games. She went to a cafe near her home, in Southern California. She was wearing pajamas. Her hair was a mess. Everyone stared. “I just wanted a day where I was left alone,” Kim says. “I appreciate that everyone loves and supports me. But I just wish people could understand what I was going through.” 

In December 2021, Kim spoke with TIME. She was preparing for the Winter Olympics in Beijing, China. They would begin on February 4. Kim looked back on how she had changed since 2018. She said, “I would tell my younger self that even though things get hard . . . it’ll get better.”
On a Journey 
Kim was born in Long Beach, California, in 2000. Her parents had moved to the United States from South Korea. When she was 4, her father took her snowboarding. She loved it. She quickly improved. Her dad would wake her up at 1 a.m. on Saturdays. They’d make the five-hour drive to practice in the mountains. 

The long trips paid off. At 13, Kim qualified for the 2014 Olympics. But she was too young to go. Four years later, she made up for lost time (see “Defying Gravity”). “She’s pushing the boundaries of what’s possible,” says Arielle Gold, a U.S. snowboarder. “She is the greatest women’s snowboarder of all time. By far.”

After the 2018 Olympics, Kim started to lose her love of the sport. “I was so burnt-out,” she says. “I just couldn’t do it anymore.” It was time for a break. Kim enrolled at Princeton University, in New Jersey, in 2019. 
In March 2020, Kim chose to return to competition. She had been working with a therapist to understand her feelings. “Just being able to let those things out that you just tuck in your little secret part of your heart helps a lot,” she says.

At the Olympics 
On February 10, at the 2022 Beijing Games, Kim won gold in the women’s halfpipe. Now 21, Kim is the first female snowboarder to win back-to-back gold medals in the halfpipe competition. 

Kim’s performance wasn’t perfect. She fell while trying to land a tough trick on two of three runs. But her incredible first run was enough. It earned her the top spot. Kim proudly accepted the gold medal. 
Defying Gravity

The 2018 Winter Olympics took place in South Korea. There, Chloe Kim set a record. She became the first woman to land back-to-back 1080s at an Olympics. A 1080 involves three full rotations in the air. 
Later that year, Kim was training  in Switzerland. She accomplished another . She became the first woman to land a front-side double cork 1080 in a halfpipe. This means she flipped herself upside down twice during an  rotation. Please don’t try this at home, kids.

47,47,Gray Wolves Re-Listed,"{'United States', 'Animals'}","
Gray wolves are going back on the endangered-species list.  A judge ruled that the animals still need protection. That was on February 10.
The United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS)  creates the endangered-species list. It took the gray wolf off the list in early 2021. “The gray wolf has exceeded all conservation goals for recovery,” David Bernhardt said. He’s a former Secretary of the Interior. 
Jeffrey S. White was the judge in the recent court case. He ruled that the USFWS “failed to adequately analyze and consider” the impact of delisting gray wolves. The decision affects most of the continental U.S.  It won’t apply in Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming. Gray wolves are already protected in Arizona and New Mexico.  
Kitty Block is president of the Humane Society of the United States. She calls the ruling a “monumental victory.” She says the USFWS “must develop a plan for meaningful recovery across the species’ range.”

Last fall, about 60 NBA scouts visited a new sports arena in Atlanta, Georgia. On the court, coaches led players through drills. The scouts whispered to one another about the players they were excited to see. 
It was “pro day” for Overtime Elite (OTE). That’s a new basketball league for players between 16 and 19 years old. The league is run by Overtime, a digital sports-media company. It promises to pay its teen players a six-figure  and prepare them for a career in the NBA. “It’s a pro environment,” NBA scout Anton Marchand says.

But OTE players are taking a risk. They’re paid, which makes them professionals. That means they’re not allowed to play college basketball. And not every OTE player will make it to the NBA or another pro league. Overtime says it will contribute $100,000 toward those students’ college education. “You can’t beat that,” says Bryson Warren, a player for the league.
A New Model 
To some people, the OTE deal sounds almost too good to be true. Leagues like OTE often don’t succeed. And OTE won’t succeed unless its players get to the NBA. 
Overtime makes money through social media. It posts videos and other content to attract followers. Dan Porter is CEO. He says OTE’s opening games, in October, got 23 million views. The company has 50 million followers. Soon, it hopes to make about $300 million a year.

Porter says young people are less interested in watching sports on TV. They want stories and highlights on demand. And they want to be able to watch on their mobile devices. “If you are an ESPN or a traditional publisher, you can’t appeal to a young audience with a bunch of traditional sports programming,” he says.
Future−Focused
At pro day, scouts watched Amen and Ausar Thompson. The six-foot-seven twins came from Florida. They skipped their senior year of high school to join OTE. They also turned down college scholarships. “It’s like we’re getting to fast-forward their dreams,” says their father, Troy Thompson.

It’s not all basketball at OTE. Players spend time each day in school. The league’s teachers can help the teens earn their high school diplomas.
Amen and Ausar have thought about backup careers. They could become sports commentators. But when asked where they see themselves in the future, the brothers do not hesitate. Nor do the other OTE players. “The NBA.”

More than 1,600 artists from 100 countries entered the 2021 Youth with Refugees Art Contest. The competition is run by the United Nations’ refugee agency (UNHCR). It challenged young people to design a soccer ball based on a theme: “Together through sport.” Five winners were announced this school year.
Nadira Ganji, 17, was one of the winners. Her design features athletes playing a variety of games. Nadira was inspired by watching sports on TV. “They were all players coming from different backgrounds,” she told TIME for Kids. “All with different abilities.""

Nadira can relate. She’s differently abled. She’s also a refugee. At 12, she was forced to flee Afghanistan. Today, she lives with her family in India. 
James Cowley Lane, 10, is from Ireland. His winning design uses a symbol. James says it stands for hope. Its colors mean something too. “White equals peace, red equals courage, and blue equals freedom,” he says. 
“When I play soccer,” James says, “I forget all my worries.” He had heard about refugees in the news. He saw the art contest as a way to help those in need.

 
On the Ball
The five winning entries in the Youth with Refugees Art Contest were turned into real soccer balls. This was done by a charity called Alive and Kicking. “The designs that won look just brilliant,” Ben Sadler says. He’s the group’s CEO. Money from sales supports sports programs for refugees.

52,52,New Nutrition Rules,"{'United States', 'Food and Nutrition'}","
The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) is updating school nutrition standards. The announcement was made on February 4. The new rules are meant to help cafeterias serve more-healthy meals. Schools have found it difficult to provide nutritious meals because of supply shortages. These have been caused by the pandemic.  
Tom Vilsack is the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture. He says the new policies should get schools on track toward meeting higher nutrition guidelines.
Cafeterias will be allowed to serve low-fat chocolate milk instead of only nonfat. There will be a new standard for the percentage of whole grains in school meals. And in fall 2023, the sodium limit for meals must decrease by 10%. 
School meals have become more healthy since 2012. The USDA set higher standards then. Vilsack says the new rules “will help schools transition to a future that builds on the tremendous strides they’ve made . . . over the past decade.”

And they’ll speak up about climate change at rallies and marches. But you don’t need to wait for Earth Day to help the planet. Many people take steps to protect the environment every day. No action is too small—and small actions can add up to big change.
Junior Journalists, we want to know: Who's your Earth hero? Think about the people in your community. Who is working to protect the environment? Maybe a friend organized a park cleanup. Or a local business owner has cut down on waste. Think about who inspires you. Find out what that person is doing, and why. Then share your planetary hero’s story. You can write, draw, or vlog.

57,57,Kid of the Year Orion Jean,"{'Young Game Changers', 'United States'}","
The wait is over! Since December, we’ve been introducing readers to Kid of the Year nominees. The winner was announced on February 9 during a TV special on Nickelodeon. The top honor went to 11-year-old Orion Jean. He was selected from a field of more than 5,000 nominees. Orion leads campaigns to help people in need. Along the way, he has inspired others to join his crusade for kindness.

“If you see a problem, fix it.” That’s how Orion Jean describes his work. Orion sees himself as an ambassador for kindness. He finds ways to help others wherever he sees a need. It might be collecting and donating 100,000 meals to food-insecure families or half a million books to kids with none at home. At a time when people are feeling isolated and divided, Orion sees a better, kinder world. It’s the world we could have if more people like him brought communities together to help their neediest members. Orion spoke with actor and humanitarian Angelina Jolie over Zoom from his home, in Fort Worth, Texas.  

 
Angelina Jolie: Can you explain your work and how it came to be? 
Orion: When the pandemic began, people were losing their jobs, homes, and access to food and other essential things. I wanted to help. But the opportunity actually came when my teacher suggested I enter the National Kindness Speech Contest in 2020. I won, and with the prize money, I started a kindness  to help people.
 Jolie: You’ve said that kindness is a choice. How can people make that choice? 
Orion: We can’t force others to be kind, but we can be kind ourselves and hope to inspire other people. So many people have great ideas but never act on them. I want others to know that they can start today. If there’s an issue or problem you want to solve, all it takes is just knowing deep down that it’s something you care about.
Jolie: You really have a gift for sharing warmth and kindness. Do you ever feel overwhelmed or sad when you see people who are unkind? 
Orion: Absolutely. One thing about being kind is that you perk up when you hear other people being unkind, or when you hear about people who aren’t doing the right thing. And it makes you sad inside. I hope that by spreading kindness, I can inspire people to change their ways and be more kind in the future.
 
Jolie: It feels better to be kind, doesn’t it?  
Orion: Yes. Kindness can be as easy as not being mean to someone, not talking behind their back or posting that mean comment on social media. That’s what kindness can be. It can just be as simple as not being cruel.
Jolie: So, I know you also started an initiative around books. Tell me that story.  
Orion: I’ve loved books ever since I can remember. To me, literacy is something that can get you off the ground. It can allow you eventually to get that job, or maybe it’s just a way for you to escape your everyday life, to learn about a new person or culture. Some kids don’t have access to any books. They live in book . I want to get books out to those areas. I don’t do this on my own. I have a whole team behind me: my parents, family, all the generous corporate donors and organizations. They’re doing this because they feel compelled to help people in their community.
Jolie: How do you balance activism with just being a kid?
 Orion: I’ve tried musical instruments, like drums and piano. I play video games with friends. Just taking time to relax and be 11. Self-care is important, just every now and then knowing when to step back and take a break.
Jolie: You have such an understanding of what’s important in life. It’s really an honor to meet you. 
Orion: The pleasure, believe me, is all mine.

58,58,The Kid Report: Space Training,"{'Science', 'Space'}","
The story “Space Training” is about NASA’s new class of astronaut recruits. It appears in this week’s issue of TIME for Kids. Here, Kid Reporter Lucy Sandor talks with Pam Melroy, NASA's deputy administrator. Melroy explains why the next generation of astronauts should reflect America’s diversity.

NASA recently launched its Artemis program. The plan is to send astronauts to the moon for the first time in more than 50 years. Among them will be the first woman and the first person of color to land on the moon. I asked NASA deputy administrator Pam Melroy about this. “NASA is the American space agency,” she says. “Our astronauts are the face of America.” Melroy is a former astronaut herself. She says it’s important for kids—future scientists and astronauts—to have role models. She didn’t have them when she was growing up. “We can do better,” Melroy says. “In our new astronaut class, there are women and men, and there are people of color. They’re all super smart. It will be helpful for everybody to see that space is for everyone.”

59,59,Space Training,"{'United States', 'Space'}","
In December, NASA introduced a new class of astronaut recruits. The space agency chose these 10 people from more than 12,000 who applied. 
Last month, the recruits reported to the Johnson Space Center, in Houston, Texas, to begin their training. Over the next two years, they’ll learn many skills. These will include spacewalking and operating systems on the International Space Station (ISS). When their training is done, the new astronauts will be assigned to missions. They might do research aboard the ISS. They might even fly to the moon. 
TIME for Kids talked with two of the recruits: Anil Menon and Christopher Williams. They discussed their backgrounds and what they look forward to during training. 
Launching a Dream 
Anil Menon has wanted to be an astronaut since he was a kid. “It seemed so exciting,” he says. “Like science fiction.” 
Menon was a flight surgeon for SpaceX. His job was to look after astronauts’ health. He has also served as a flight surgeon for NASA. He treated astronauts on the ISS. 

Menon says his experience has given him “skills to contribute” as an astronaut. For now, he’s excited about working with the other recruits as part of a “small team, taking care of one another and making sure everyone’s successful.” 
Christopher Williams is a medical physicist. He uses physics to develop medical treatments and technologies. Williams has worked at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. Both are in Boston, Massachusetts. 

Now Williams is gearing up for Houston. There’s one thing he’s particularly eager to learn: how to fly jets. Operating a T-38 jet is another skill the trainees will have to master. 
Both future astronauts point to the challenges they’ll face in the coming months. But they’re excited to tackle them. “Just because you haven’t done something before doesn’t mean you can’t get good at it,” Williams says.

Hi! My name is Hunter. Welcome back to TIME for Kids Sports Live! We will be covering my flag football game. I'm one of the running backs. It was the closest game this season. It was the fifth-grade Gators (3–0) vs. the Trojans (3–0). We started the game with the ball in our possession, and with me getting the ball and throwing it to our quarterback. Bam! He scored. That’s the story of the week.
The game was getting intense. Everyone was getting quiet. We were down (24–26), but it’s fourth and goal and our ball. The other team blitzes our quarterback. He runs around two opposing players and dives into the end zone. We won! The final score was 30–26. We’re still undefeated. After the game, everyone was tired. The Gators are now 4–0 and the Trojans are 3–1.

Hello again, Junior Journalist! School is a big part of your life—and we know it’s an extra-special adventure right now. This week’s assignment is to explore how kids are learning.
Mission 3: How Are You Learning?
Since the COVID-19 pandemic began, kids have been learning in all sorts of ways. Many schools went remote but eventually invited students back into classrooms. When the Omicron variant started spreading, some schools switched back to virtual learning while some didn’t. Kids (and adults!) tell us the uncertainty is enough to make their heads spin.

From Henry M. (10, North Carolina) and Chris P. (11, North Carolina): “Masks and social distancing are the new normal now. The masks are very annoying, but they are still here to keep us safe. Being in school is fun, but we miss seeing each other's faces. We usually eat outside. When it is too cold, we eat inside six feet away from each other. Everyone is getting used to wearing masks and all the other COVID protocols.”
From Gabrielle M. (10, Pennsylvania): “School hasn’t been so tough. I’ve been at school ever since the beginning of the 2021–2022 school year. I used to be in online school, and it was bad. I had to clear up space to put a desk in and go to my school every few weeks to get materials. We couldn’t even talk to our friends! Now I have some interesting friends on the bus and a perfect bus driver. The only problem is that me and my neighbors had to wait in the cold. I also have an amazing teacher. To be honest, I’m sad that I have to leave elementary school for middle school, but I’m ready for new adventures!”
From Veer M. (11, India): ""Going back to in-person classes, I felt very scared. What if they don’t like me? What if I don’t make friends? What if I spend all my time in the back seat alone? But to my surprise, they were all like me, and we instantly became friends. I was nervous about the teachers as well, but they were kind and welcoming. I was sitting alone until somebody came and sat next to me. I was having fun after a long time. Sure, I had to wear triple-layered masks, but I adjusted to them instantly. I had to be careful and sanitize my hands regularly, but you get used to it.”
From Elanie L. (7, California): ”During the COVID-19 pandemic my learning has changed. When the pandemic first started I was in kindergarten. I went to school every day before the pandemic. But now I have to do school online. Now I am in second grade, but I am still doing school online.
For me, everything stays the same. It feels like being in school every day–doing classes, doing homework, and not having much time to play. But some things are different, too. Now my classroom is at home in my living room. I do not get to play with my friends in person. I can’t go to the library to check out books. I have to read books online or at home.
In first grade, I still had art, music, and PE classes online, but now in second grade I don’t have those classes. Now for art, I draw when I am finished with my homework. For music, I have piano lessons online and I practice every day. For PE, I go outside and play basketball with my parents or my grandpa. On weekends my parents and I hike or ride bikes.”
From Miles P. (9, Massachusetts): “I have gone back to in-person learning. It has been a lot nicer than remote learning, except for lunch because we have to face one way and be silent which is very annoying. I feel more engaged in what we are learning and doing in class. My classmates and I are doing pretty well. I don't mind face masks but some other students have trouble keeping their masks over their noses. Overall, in-person learning has been going pretty well.”
From Aaron B. (10, Massachusetts): “I have gone back to in person learning and I'm happy I can see my friends again! It's been really interesting because we were at our homes for a very long time. It was just so different when the people who run the schools were just like, ‘Okay, now you can go to school again.’ My classmates and I are doing fine, and we can still go on FaceTime and Zoom, especially on the weekends. We do COVID testing every Tuesday. We can still do virtual activities on Zoom, which is pretty awesome. At snack and lunch we are silent and don't sit close to each other. But overall it is still awesome!”
From Molly V. (10, Massachusetts): “My school has gone back to in-person learning. This experience has been okay. I mean, it’s sad that we probably will not go back to normal and that we have to wear masks. But it's for our own safety. During this time I have also been a lot more positive than I used to be. And that has really changed me. Even if this time has been kind of okay for me, I know that there are a lot of other people who are really struggling. I think when grown-ups say to not worry about it, kids get even more worried. So I highly recommend to be honest with people about your feelings. But anyways, in our school, lunch and recess have been a little bit different. You have to be 6 feet apart without your mask on, and we do not eat in the cafeteria like we used to. Well, unless it is a rainy, snowy, or extremely cold day. That's all I really have to say.”
From Simran A. (7, Michigan): ""I have been learning in a hybrid setting. I go to school when cases are low and learn virtually during a surge. Here is a COVID doll that I made in my Science of Toys class at school. The doll is double-masked. She is wearing two K95 masks like I do, and she is fully vaccinated.""

Kids have a lot on their minds. Juggling school, family, and activities is hard enough. Add to this list a pandemic. It’s disrupting schedules. It’s causing uncertainty. That’s a recipe for a mental health crisis. 
“When we feel stressed, we get together with friends,” United States surgeon general Vivek Murthy told TFK Kid Reporter Ronak Bhatt. They spoke over Zoom on January 5. “We talk to family members. We go visit people we love. Those things became harder, especially when kids weren’t in school last year.” 
Ronak can relate. “The recent rise in Omicron cases is causing stress all over again,” he told Dr. Murthy. “Some schools, mine included, decided to go virtual.”

The surgeon general is the country’s top doctor. In December 2021, Dr. Murthy released an advisory on kids’ mental health. The report is meant to “call people’s attention to an urgent public health problem,” he says. “For a long time, even before COVID-19, young people have been struggling with their mental health.”
In It Together 
Everyone can help protect kids’ mental health. The advisory urges communities to come together on this. “If we seize this moment, step up for our children and their families in their moment of need, and lead with inclusion, kindness, and respect,” Dr. Murthy writes in his introduction, “we can lay the foundation for a healthier, more , and more fulfilled nation.”

Some groups have already begun to lay that foundation. In August 2021, the U.S. government announced nearly $85 million in funding. It’s for groups that provide mental health services for kids. They focus on things like raising awareness and making it easier for kids to get care.  
“It’s a great first start,” Amy Knight told National Public Radio. She’s president of the Children’s Hospital Association. Dr. Warren Ng, of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent , added that the funding is “a step in the right direction.” But he noted that “more is definitely needed.”
Take Care 
TIME for Kids often hears from readers. Many have been dealing with tough emotions. Some report being nervous. Others say they’re lonely. “I struggle with anxiety,” a 14-year-old wrote. “The COVID pandemic has made me feel a lot of ways,” a 10-year-old wrote, “but mostly sad.”
“You can’t always tell from the outside whether somebody is doing well,” Dr. Murthy says. “It’s so important to check in on people.” The advisory lists ways that kids can help. Listening is one. Another is telling a friend in need that you’re there. “Asking for help is never a sign of weakness,” Dr. Murthy says. “It’s often a sign of strength.”
Ways to Feel Better
On sad days, it can be hard to think of ways to cheer yourself up. So it’s a good plan to have a bunch of feel-better ideas at the ready. TFK Kid Reporter Ronak Bhatt asked U.S. surgeon general Vivek Murthy for some tips. Read them below.
1. Pay attention to how you feel. “This might sound like an obvious one,” Dr. Murthy says. “But a lot of times, we can go for a long time feeling sad or worried or stressed and not recognize that.” Take a pause. Breathe. Check in with yourself. How are you feeling today?
2. Connect with people you love. Reaching out to friends and family can “make a huge difference,” Dr. Murthy says. You don’t have to discuss anything sad or serious. Just talking or spending time with others can improve your mood. It can help you feel connected.
3. Talk to a trusted adult. If you’re feeling down, Dr. Murthy suggests confiding in a trusted adult. This might be a family member. It could be a friend. Maybe it’s a teacher or a coach. “A lot of schools have counselors or school nurses you can check in with,” he adds.
4. Find sources of inspiration. Keep a list of things that make you feel good when you read, watch, or listen to them. “We all need a toolbox of things that we can reach for,” Dr. Murthy says. “Poems, songs, books, speeches—whatever it might be for you.”
5. Take care of your body. Eat well. Stay hydrated. Get good sleep. Fresh air helps. Exercise does, too. “I found that when I’m physically active, it actually lifts my mood,” Dr. Murthy says. “It also has the benefit of getting my mind off of some of the challenges I have.”
6. Help others. Dr. Murthy says that one of the best ways to fight sadness is through service. “When we help other people, not only do we strengthen our [connections],” he says, “we also remind ourselves that we have a lot of beauty and value and strength to add to the world.”

66,66,Olympic Update,"{'Sports', 'World'}","
Organizers of the 2022 Winter Olympics, in Beijing, China, say only “selected” spectators will be allowed to attend the Games. No tickets will be sold to the general public. The announcement was made on January 17. It’s the latest step China has taken to fight another coronavirus outbreak. 
The Beijing Olympics are scheduled to begin on February 4. It could be the most restricted large-scale sporting event since the pandemic began. The committee had already barred fans from outside China from attending.
Safety measures in China are becoming stricter with the spread of the Omicron variant. It is more contagious than past strains of the coronavirus. Beijing has confirmed its first case of Omicron. The variant was also found in Tianjin, about 70 miles from there.
At the Games, spectators will be allowed to clap. But they won’t be allowed to cheer. That can spread the virus. Robots will disinfect surfaces. Organizers say these measures will “create a pleasant environment for the holding of the Games.”

An underwater volcano erupted on January 15. It happened near Tonga. That’s an island nation in the South Pacific Ocean. The blast sent ash, gas, and soot about 12 miles above the ocean’s surface. It also triggered a tsunami. On Tonga’s main island, water levels rose nearly three feet in some areas. Most people were able to escape. Nearly all the homes were destroyed on at least three of Tonga’s islands. 
At press time, the Tonga government reported three deaths. Officials were still studying the damage. Fatafehi Fakafanua is a political leader in Tonga. According to the New York Times, he said on social media that “Tonga needs immediate assistance to provide its citizens with fresh drinking water and food.”

Who will become Kid of the Year for 2021? The answer will be revealed on February 9 during a TV special on Nickelodeon. In the weeks leading up to the show, we’ve been introducing the top five nominees. Read on!
A few years ago, Cash Daniels was walking on a beach when he found some plastic. He started thinking about the impact plastic pollution has on the environment, especially on rivers and oceans. That’s when he got interested in environmental issues.
Cash, now 12, found that rivers are at the heart of the problem. A 2021 report in Science Advances said that far more rivers are carrying large amounts of plastic into our oceans than was once thought. This news hit close to home for Cash. He lives in Chattanooga, Tennessee. The city sits on the Tennessee River. It’s one of the most polluted rivers in the world. 
This information led Cash to take action. He made it his mission to clear trash from public spaces and waterways. 
River Rescue
At first, Cash and his parents worked to pick up garbage near the Tennessee River. But Cash soon realized he would need more help. So he organized community cleanup outings. Eventually, he and other volunteers removed more than 11,000 pounds of garbage from the river. 
Cash has also partnered with businesses to recycle aluminum cans. He has recycled more than 2,000 pounds of them. The money he earns from that supports river conservation efforts. 

Cash loves marine animals. By cleaning waterways, he helps protect these creatures. He set up fishing-line recycling containers along the Tennessee River. People can  fishing line in these instead of in the water, where it entangles wildlife.	 
Kids’ Impact  
Cash enjoys getting other kids involved in activism. He wrote a children’s book called One Small Piece. 

It’s about pollution in waterways and oceans. Cash also cofounded the Cleanup Kids. The group encourages children to recycle litter. “Kids may be a small percentage of the population,” Cash says. “But they are 100% of the future.”

Who will become Kid of the Year for 2021? The answer will be revealed on February 9 during a TV special on Nickelodeon. In the weeks leading up to the show, we’ve been introducing the top five nominees. Read on!
Lino Marrero is a 14-year-old from Frisco, Texas. One day at soccer practice, Lino found that his smartphone was dead. He remembered a lesson in school on kinetic energy. That’s the energy produced by an object in motion. It’s the way a kick causes a soccer ball to move. Lino thought, “What if I could use the energy I wasted on the field to charge my phone?”

That  moment led Lino to invent the Kinetic Kickz 2.0. It’s like a rechargeable battery that fits into a shoe. It collects energy from walking. This energy can then be used to power portable devices. 
Lino says this technology could be more efficient and less expensive than other sources of  energy. He told Spectrum News 1, in Texas: “The Kinetic Kickz 2.0 taps into human kinetic energy as a new, clean alternative-energy source.” 

A device like this could help people around the world who don’t have access to electricity. “Being able to even light up a little lightbulb on their ceiling would make a big difference,” Lino says.
In 2019, Lino won awards for his invention at the Invention Convention U.S. Nationals. In 2021, he won first place for grades 6 to 8 at the Invention Convention Globals. Those were held virtually.

A Natural Inventor
Lino made his first invention when he was in fourth grade. He played the cello. And he was having trouble. “A lot of people quit their stringed instruments because of calluses and blisters that make it painful to play,” he says. So Lino invented the String Ring. It’s an adjustable band that protects the fingers. He’s developing one for guitar players, too.

“It’s usually been about helping other people, for me,” Lino says. “Kids are better inventors than grown-ups, at times. I just want to inspire more people to want to become inventors and help change the world.”

“Music is where everything started,” Samirah Horton says. She’s 13 and from Brooklyn, New York. Samirah is known to the world as DJ Annie Red. She has been performing and rapping since she was 6. Through music, DJ Annie Red says, “I can express myself.”

The rising hip-hop star uses music to talk about bullying. “I was bullied a lot,” she says. “I still am bullied now, especially because of my voice.” DJ Annie Red has a deep voice. She says people have told her she sounds like a boy.
But she rises above their insults. DJ Annie Red doesn’t think of her voice as a weakness. She uses it to spread a message far and wide. She  kids of all ages, everywhere, to stand up to bullying. “You’re never too young to make a change,” she says.
Sharing Songs
DJ Annie Red has performed at events and festivals. She is the “kid resident DJ” for Brooklyn’s pro-basketball team. And she posts her music online.

DJ Annie Red also performs at schools. She likes to give students “a catchy, rhythmic, interactive show” while teaching them how to overcome bullying. She says she wants to help kids who are suffering “feel like they’re not alone.”
At school shows, DJ Annie Red mixes music. She has held dance contests. She has asked students to make an antibullying . And she has read from The Bully Stop. It’s a book based on her song “No You Won’t Bully Me.”

Inspiring Change
DJ Annie Red says that standing up to bullying is more important than ever. That’s partly because people can bully others on social media while hiding behind a username. “You don’t have to show your face at all,” she says.
But she sees a brighter future ahead. DJ Annie Red believes that kids can use their passions to inspire change, as she has. “That’s something I really enjoy seeing,” she says. “Kids being more confident in themselves and wanting to do something that they really enjoy doing is something that motivates me.”

Hi there, Junior Journalist! Ready for your first TFK Press Club mission? Grab your press badge, something to write on, and something to write with. Then, read on...
Mission 1: What Do You Stand For?
Martin Luther King Jr. Day falls on the third Monday of January each year. This year, we celebrate on January 17. It’s a day to remember and honor the great Civil Rights leader. He delivered a speech on August 28, 1963, in which he described his dream for America. More than 250,000 people gathered at the Lincoln Memorial, in Washington, D.C., to stand up for what they believed. They carried signs to help their voices be heard. 
Protesters often carry signs to share their demands and beliefs. They can educate others or ask others to join a cause. Carrying a sign shows you are taking a stand.
Junior Journalists, we want to know: What do you stand for? What issues are important to you and your friends? Write to us! You can also share a photo, video, or drawing. Then have a teacher, parent, or guardian send it to us here or at tfkpressclub@time.com. Some submissions from Junior Journalists will be featured in TIME for Kids.

Hear from Junior Journalists
From Ian S. (11, Florida): “I stand for Black Lives Matter. It is unfair that people are treated differently just because of the color of their skin, or their race. We are all humans and should be treated the same.”
From Greter E. (11, Florida): “I stand for women's rights. It is not right that women still get treated very differently, just because of their gender. Aren't we all people? Don't we deserve the same rights? At the end of the ​day, we all live on the same planet.”
From Sofia F. (10, Florida): “I stand for peaceful protesting. I think peaceful protesting is very important for getting your voice heard without giving anyone a reason to not listen to you. A good example is Gandhi. Gandhi peacefully protested to free India from Britain. Even when the British used violence, Gandhi did not.”
From Jade C. (8, California): “I have been standing up for clean air since I was 5. When I was in kindergarten, I saw that many parents left their engines running when they got out of the car to pick up their children. It bothered me. I made a poster saying, ‘Save the polar bears! Please don’t let the engine idle when picking up your child.’ I posted it at the gate, but it didn’t work well. Many parents still left their engine running. I was sad. I talked to my mom. She told me that maybe not everyone cares about polar bears. I thought about it, and when I was in second grade, I made another poster. I said ‘Keep the air clean for the children. Please don’t leave the engine running!’ It worked a little better. More parents turned off their engines when picking up their children. Now I am in third grade. I continue to come up with new ideas to advocate for clean air.”
From Shrimayee I. (9, California): ""I stand against climate change. Climate change is making the environment immensely worse for us and for all other living organisms, as well. Take polar bears, for example. The ice is softening because of global warming, which is one impact of climate change. According to WWF, the population of polar bears is projected to decline 30% by 2050. The ice is where polar bears live. What can we do about it? Scientists say that within our lifetime, we can’t bring the world back to how it was before climate change. But we can prevent it from getting worse. Climate experts say that we are the ones who started it. I think we’ll be able to end it, too. How? We can start by burning fewer things and creating less pollution. That’s one of the main causes of climate change. Another thing we can do is decrease intensive animal farming. Last but not least, we can grow more trees, flowers, and plants. That way, there will be less carbon dioxide in the air and more oxygen for every living organism. The plants suck in the carbon dioxide that we give out. That’s what we can do about climate change.""
From Mrs. Gahren's kindergarten class:

From Ms. Strelsin's third-grade class: 

From Hadleigh H. (8, Ohio): ""I think we should help save the environment. I have some rules for you to hear and follow. One, do not litter or feed wild animals. Two, turn off lights in the rooms you are not using. Three, recycle reusable things. I think that you should save animals because if we do not have animals then we won't have Earth to live on and we don't want that.""
From Simran A. (7, Michigan): ""I want to stand up against bullying. Martin Luther King believed in nonviolence, like Mahatma Gandhi. I also read that Mahatma Gandhi had a great way to respond to bullies. He simply said he doesn't accept what they have to offer so it goes back to them. I think we should do the same to fight this problem.""

Amazon’s delivery drones were supposed to be in full flight by now. In 2013, the online retailer announced a new drone delivery service. Packages containing anything from toothpaste to a smartphone would arrive at your home by drone. The drone would land. It would drop your package. Then it would fly away. 
Amazon founder Jeff Bezos said at the time that the service would take four or five years to develop. But it’s been a little more than eight years. The company is struggling to make progress. What happened?

Amazon “is committed to making our goal of delivering packages by drones a reality,” the company said last year. But, Amazon added, “it will continue to take time.” 
Drone delivery could have a huge impact. Drones may be even more  and environmentally friendly than electric delivery vans. But there are challenges. These include the need for more warehouses and concerns about airspace safety. 

Taking Wing
Amazon isn’t the only company working on drone delivery. Alphabet is the parent company of Google. Its drone delivery service is called Wing. In Logan, Australia, Wing’s drone deliveries have already taken off. Last August, the service announced its hundred-thousandth delivery.
James Ryan Burgess is Wing’s CEO. “You can imagine a future where there are delivery drone aircraft scattered throughout a city,” he says. “Those aircraft can serve the community.”

Wing’s drones can wirelessly charge at a landing pad. Deliveries are monitored by pilots. Routes are determined based on distance, weather conditions, and airspace regulations. Packages are dropped in front of homes using a device called a winch. This means no human interaction is needed.
Good for the Planet?
Costa Samaras is a professor at Carnegie Mellon University. That’s in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In 2018, Samaras coauthored a report. It found drone delivery to be more eco-friendly than ground delivery, over certain distances. This is especially true when drones are traveling at higher speeds.

But Samaras says drone delivery could impact wildlife (see “Drones and Wildlife”). And if it increases, providers will need space to maintain drones. That means more warehouses. And warehouses need “heat, light, and power,” Samaras says. “That amount of energy  the benefits.”
Plus, drone delivery could be noisy. Samaras asks, “Do we want hundreds or thousands of drones over all of our cities?”
Drones and Wildlife

The effect drones have on wildlife is still being researched. But videos (shot using drones) show that animals don’t love the buzzing machines. There’s a European Environment Agency report about this. It points out the tension between drones and birds. “Bird species . . . were found to be more sensitive to disturbances relating to the presence of drones,” it says. It gives an example: In Austria, a pair of eagles went after a drone. They thought it was food.

On January 7 and 8, NASA’s new space telescope unfolded its flower-shaped mirror. The James Webb Space Telescope will do its work 1 million miles from Earth. Its mission: to find evidence of how galaxies formed billions of years ago.  
Thomas Zurbuchen works on NASA’s science missions. “How does it feel to make history?” he said to his team, in Maryland. 
Webb is the most powerful telescope ever launched. It took off from South America on December 25. The entire thing was folded to fit into a rocket. 
Webb’s mirror gathers light. This allows the telescope to pick up faraway galaxies. The mirror is 21 feet across. It is made up of 18 segments. NASA adjusts them to bring the telescope into focus.
“This is the moment we have been waiting for,” Antonella Nota says. She’s a director at the European Space Agency. It worked with NASA on the telescope. Nota says NASA made Webb’s unfolding in space look “so amazingly easy.”

New rules in California put limits on outdoor water usage. They are meant to combat drought. The State Water Resources Control Board voted for the restrictions. The votes were cast on January 4. The rules include no lawn-watering for 48 hours after rain. They could take effect by the end of the month.
Dry conditions from early 2021 affected California’s water supply. Governor Gavin Newsom had previously asked people to voluntarily cut water use by 15%. But between July and November, water usage went down just 6%.
Eric Oppenheimer is the chief deputy director for the state water board. “Conserving water and reducing water waste are critical and necessary habits for everyone to adopt,” he says. “We need to be prepared for continued drought.”

81,81,From Ranch to Lab,"{'Environment', 'Science'}","
Brown cows roam the meadows of a farm in the Netherlands. They’re Limousins. This breed is known for the quality of its meat. Every few months, a veterinarian makes a tiny cut in a cow’s side, removes a sample of muscle, and stitches the cow back up. A dab of painkiller on the skin means this process doesn’t hurt much.
The samples go to a lab. Scientists put them into steel containers with a special broth. The cells grow. This creates new muscle. From that, something like hamburger meat is made. It’s a lot like what you buy at a supermarket.

One day, lab-grown meat might replace factory farming. In that system, many cows are raised in small spaces. Lab meat could be the answer to a big problem: How do you feed more and more people without creating more greenhouse-gas emissions? 
Every year, raising animals for food causes as much as 14½% of the planet’s greenhouse-gas emissions. That system is , biologist Johanna Melke says. She works for Mosa Meat. That’s a company in the Netherlands that grows meat in a lab. “People want to eat meat,” she says. “This is how we solve the problem.”

An Easier Choice 
Mark Post, Mosa’s cofounder, helped introduce the first lab-grown hamburger. That was nine years ago. Today, more than 70 companies are making lab-grown meats. (See “Something Fishy.”) These include chicken, tuna—and even mouse, for cat treats. 
Demand for meat will nearly double by 2050, according to the World Resources Institute. Lab-grown meat could be a $25 billion business.
“I can’t give up meat, and most people are like me,” Post says. “So I wanted to make the choice for those people easier: to be able to keep on eating meat without all the negative [effects].”

In Development 
So far, no company has figured out how to produce large amounts of lab-grown meat and bring down costs. Eat Just makes chicken nuggets. Three of them cost about $17 at a restaurant in Singapore. That’s a lot more than what regular nuggets cost at McDonald’s.

Cattle ranchers also stand in the way. Many want the terms beef and meat used only for products that come from animals raised in a traditional manner. That could make it harder to sell meat from a lab. “The terms you can use make a critical difference,” says Michael Dent, a market researcher. “Who’s going to buy something called ‘lab-grown cell-protein ’?”
Still, Mosa says its product can win people over. “It was so intense—a rich, beefy, meaty flavor,” says scientist Laura Jackisch, who gave up eating animal products years ago. “I started craving steak again.”
Something Fishy
Some of the fish we eat is caught faster than it can be replenished. Overfishing can wipe out whole species. 
Avant Meats makes fish meat in a lab. This includes fish maw. It’s a part of a fish that’s popular in China. Lab-grown maw feels like real fish before it’s cooked. That’s what chef Eddy Leung thinks. “But when you eat it, it doesn’t yet have the kind of stickiness the real ones do.” —By Aryn Baker for TIME, adapted by TFK editors

83,83,A Disrupted Reopening,"{'Community', 'Health'}","
Last week, many students in the United States returned to school after winter break. They did so just as COVID-19 cases were reaching record levels. 
The surge in cases has been driven by the Omicron variant. It spreads more easily than previous strains of the virus. On January 3, the U.S. reported more than a million people diagnosed with COVID-19. 
Some teachers and parents want to pause in-person learning. At least for now. Chicago is the nation’s third-largest school district. Teachers there voted on January 4 to stay home. At press time, it was unclear when Chicago students would return to in-person learning.
“Change has been the only constant in this fight,” Roger León says. He’s superintendent of public schools in Newark, New Jersey. Classes there will take place remotely for at least two weeks.
But most public schools are sticking with in-person learning. That’s out of concern for the effect remote learning has on students’ mental health and academic success.
Stricter health measures are in place in some areas. Los Angeles County is the nation’s second-largest school district. Teachers and students there must take a COVID-19 test. They can return to school only if the test is negative. Masks are required at school, even outdoors. 
Miguel Cardona is the U.S. Secretary of Education. “The goal [is] to keep all schools open for in-person learning five days a week throughout the 2021–22 school year and beyond,” he says.

Orion’s first good deed was to buy toys for patients at the Children’s Health hospital in Dallas, Texas. He used his $500 prize from the speech contest. Then he began his first Race to Kindness campaign, the Race to 500 Toys. It encouraged others to donate toys, too.
He didn’t stop there. Seeing hunger in his community, Orion partnered with food drives and a relief group. They collected more than 100,000 meals for Texas families. 

Giving is just one of Orion’s passions. Another is reading. He has combined the two in the Race to 500,000 Books. 
Life’s Mission
In 2021, the group Reading Is Fundamental published the results of a survey. It showed that 94% of teachers, parents, and caregivers are concerned that students don’t have access to print books. “There are people who live in areas where it’s almost impossible to get [books],” Orion says. “It breaks my heart.” 

Orion has worked with several organizations. They held events where people donated books. He reached his goal of collecting 500,000 books.

Orion is an author himself. He has written A Kids Book About Leadership. He says his purpose in life is to  pain where he finds it. We can all aspire to that, he says. “When people come together for a common cause, great things can happen.”

86,86,Let's Talk! With Lisa Yee,"{'Books', 'Time Off'}","
Maizy, the main character of Lisa Yee's Maizy Chen’s Last Chance, is a Chinese-American girl from Los Angeles. She’s spending the summer in Last Chance, Minnesota, where her grandparents own a restaurant. They’re the only Asian-American people in town. After the restaurant becomes the target of a racist attack, Maizy sets out to learn more about her family’s history.
1. Was this story inspired by your childhood?  
Like Maizy, I was born and raised in Los Angeles. Later, I moved to a part of the country where I was the only Asian-American person around. People would ask where I was from. I’d say, “Los Angeles,” and they’d say, “No, where are you really from?” I didn’t get it, at first. When you’re comfortable in your surroundings, you don’t think about it. Then you step outside of your comfort zone. That’s what Maizy has to do.
2. Maizy is also a writer, like you. 
Yes, she observes customers at the restaurant and writes fortunes for them. This makes people happy. Maizy might not realize it, but she’s a storyteller. She has the power of words.
3. Some of the book is told from the perspective of Maizy’s great-great-grandfather Lucky.
I learned so much in researching the Chinese-American experience. I imagined what it would be like to come to America, not knowing anybody or speaking the language. I could have written an entire book about Lucky’s adventures.
4. What can readers learn from the book?
I hope it inspires you to ask your mom or dad, or grandma and grandpa, what was it like for them growing up. As a kid, I should have listened, the way Maizy does. We all have amazing stories in our families. They need to come out.

87,87,Buses Go Electric,"{'Environment', 'United States'}","
Thomas Built Buses is a company in High Point, North Carolina. Workers at its school-bus factory are thrilled about a new government law. It’s the  bill. President Joe Biden signed it into law on November 15. Among other things, it sets aside money to help communities buy battery-powered school buses.
 
That’s good news for Thomas Built. And it’s good news for Chris Pratt. He’s president of a local union. He has also worked as a welder at the Thomas Built plant for 22 years. To him, the new law means one thing: more jobs. “This is something huge for us,” Pratt says.

 
 
The infrastructure law sets aside $2½ billion for electric school buses. That’s a tiny chunk of the more than $1 trillion it will invest to build or improve things like roads and bridges. But for workers like those in High Point, this money is a very big deal. It’s also important for people trying to get rid of  fumes on children’s bus rides. 
 
Charging Ahead
 
There are about 500,000 school buses in the United States. They move 26 million kids every day. About 95% of those buses run on diesel fuel. This adds up to more than 5 million tons of pollution from greenhouse gases a year.

 
 
Inhaling fumes from diesel-powered buses is bad for kids. It has been linked to lower test scores. It can also cause breathing problems. When sitting inside those buses, kids often breathe the most polluted air they’re exposed to all day. 
 
It’s hard to produce electric versions of some vehicles. Big trucks are an example. They need huge batteries. And these batteries require long charging times. Making electric school buses would be easier. They don’t usually travel long distances. And there’s plenty of time to charge them during the school day or at night. Making school buses electric would help the environment. It would be better for kids’ health, too. 

 
 
There are only about 1,200 electric school buses in the U.S. The new government money could bump that number to about 10,000. This could happen within five years. 
 
Jobs on the Way
 
Kevin Bangston is CEO of Thomas Built. He says the company will soon be hiring a “pretty significant” number of workers. Pratt says the new positions can’t come soon enough. “People come from hours away for these jobs,” he says.  
 
More jobs could be coming at other factories, too. Sanford Bishop is a congressman in Georgia. He represents a district that’s home to a Blue Bird bus factory. Bishop expects there to be more bus-building jobs soon. That would help his community financially. “It makes good environmental sense” too, Bishop says.  
 
A Clean and Green Future 
 
There’s a bill called the Clean  for Kids Act of 2021. It’s making its way through Congress. It will make a big impact if it becomes law. The bill was introduced by Alex Padilla. He’s a senator from California. The bill would set aside $25 billion. That would pay for pollution-free school buses. It’s enough to replace nearly half of the diesel-burning school buses (pictured below) on U.S. roads. Padilla called the bill “a wise investment in our children, our environment, and our future.”

88,88,TIME Person of the Year,"{'People', 'History'}","
Elon Musk has been named TIME’s 2021 Person of the Year. The news was announced on December 13.
“Person of the Year is a marker of influence,” Edward Felsenthal says. He’s TIME’s editor in chief. “Few individuals have had more influence than Musk on life on Earth, and potentially life off Earth too.”
Musk is the founder of the rocket company SpaceX. It’s building a spacecraft that will take astronauts to the moon. Musk is also the CEO of the electric-car company Tesla. Its success has pushed other automakers to build electric vehicles. This could be key to fighting climate change. Robots and solar power are among Musk’s other business interests. “Like it or not, we are now in Musk’s world,” Felsenthal says.
TIME also announced winners in three other categories. Heroes of the Year went to four scientists: Kizzmekia Corbett, Barney Graham, Katalin Karikó, and Drew Weissman. They helped formulate the COVID-19 vaccine. Their work has helped slow the pandemic. 
Athlete of the Year went to Simone Biles, who brought attention to mental health. Entertainer of the Year was Olivia Rodrigo. Two of her songs debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100.

89,89,KOTY Nominee: Meet Mina,"{'Young Game Changers', 'Community'}","
Who will become Kid of the Year for 2021? The answer will be revealed on February 9 during a TV special on Nickelodeon. In the weeks leading up to the show, we’ll be introducing the top five nominees. Read on!
Mina Fedor and her mom were walking near their home, in Piedmont, California. A stranger coughed at her mom. Mina knew what it meant. Her mom is Korean. Lately, there has been a rise in discrimination and attacks against Asian Americans. They are fueled by a false belief that Asians are responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic.

That moment was an eye-opener for Mina. She had to speak out against racism. So she and her friends organized a rally. It took place in Berkeley, California, in March 2021. Mina expected about 70 people. More than 1,200 showed up. They carried signs: “I Am Not a Virus” and “Stop Asian Hate!!!” Mina led the crowd on a march to a footbridge over a freeway. They posted their signs on the fence. Cars passing below honked in support.
Mina knows that racism isn’t new. But COVID-19 has brought a new wave of prejudice. Asian Americans fought back in the past. Like them, Mina is rising to her moment.

Spreading the Word
Mina is now 13. She isn’t new to activism. She went to her first rally in 2017. It was the Women’s March in Los Angeles. Mina might seem like a naturally outspoken kid, but that’s not the case. She has been described as quietly . At the Berkeley rally, she overcame her nervousness to speak to the crowd. She believes young people should be heard.

That day, Mina founded AAPI Youth Rising (AAPI stands for “Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders”). This group of middle school activists worked to get a law passed. It makes teaching ethnic studies  in California public high schools. The group also partners with national organizations to support education on racism, ethnic diversity, and AAPI issues in schools.
Many instances of anti-Asian discrimination are not reported in the news. That’s why Mina is outspoken. She won’t be silent in the face of hate.
Correction: An earlier version of this story noted that AAPI Youth Rising was working to get a law passed that would make teaching ethnic studies mandatory in California public schools. That law passed in October 2021.

91,91,8 Questions for Sylvia Earle,"{'People', 'Science'}","
Sylvia Earle is a marine biologist. She’s one of the ocean’s biggest defenders. TIME’s Aryn Baker spoke to her about protecting the seas and Earle’s dream of access to submersibles for all.
1. You’ve written several books about the ocean. Why this one—National Geographic Ocean: A Global Odyssey—and why now?
This book is my attempt to sum up what we know about the ocean. If you’ve got 10 minutes, you can sit down and learn something, with beautiful images.
2. Why is the ocean so important? 
The ocean is where the action is. If I were an evil alien wishing to alter life on Earth, I would change the temperature of the ocean. That is what we are doing. The ocean is becoming more acidic.
3. What is the single most important thing we can do for the oceans today?
We’ve got to get over the idea that wildlife from the ocean is essential to food security. The more fish we take out of the sea, the more  gets released into the atmosphere. 
4. What is the biggest threat to the ocean right now?  
Deep-sea mining.  
5. We’ve seen major losses of coral reefs. What gives you hope?
Yes, half the coral reefs are gone or in a state of sharp decline. But we’ve still got half of them left. We can reverse, to a very large extent, the harm we’ve imposed. Knowledge is the superpower of the 21st century. Even the smartest people alive when I was born did not know what 10-year-olds today have available to them. That’s truly cause for hope. 
6. Ocean advocates have set a goal to protect 30% of the ocean by 2030. Can we achieve that? 
COVID-19 showed us that we can change quickly when our lives are threatened. Climate is no different. Our existence is on the line. Thirty percent by 2030 is a good start. But I say half, as soon as we can.  
7. What do you say to those experiencing climate anxiety? 
It’s only hopeless when you give up. Change happens because of people who team up to inspire others. 
8. What’s next for you?
I’ve committed to providing access to the sea with little . They will enable teachers, kids, librarians—anybody—to experience what only a few of us have been able to. I want them to dive down safely, come back, and spread the word about how glorious life is down below.

92,92,Pictures of 2021,"{'World', 'History'}","
There’s no question that 2021 was as momentous as 2020. Like last year, this one was defined by wildfires and protests for social justice. And around the world, the pandemic continues.

94,94,Volcanic Eruption,"{'World', 'Earth Science'}","
A volcano in Indonesia erupted on December 4. Mount Semeru shot clouds of ash 40,000 feet into the air. Hot gas and lava killed at least 34 people. Others are still missing.
“Trees, farms, houses are scorched, everything is covered in heavy gray ash,” Haryadi Purnomo says. He works for East Java’s search and rescue agency.
Some 3,000 houses and 38 schools were damaged. Thousands of people were evacuated.
Days of rain triggered the eruption. Atop Semeru is a dome of lava. Rain caused it to fall apart. Experts say it could break up even more. That could cause an avalanche.
Semeru has erupted many times in the last 200 years. There were no deaths the last time it erupted, in January. 
Indonesia’s government said it would help villagers who lost their homes. They will be moved to a safer place within six months. They’ll be given financial help while they wait.

A year has passed since the first TIME Kid of the Year TV special aired on Nickelodeon. We introduced Bellen, Gitanjali, Ian, Jordan, and Tyler. Gitanjali was named the 2020 Kid of the Year. Since then, these kids have been busy. Read their updates below. And stay tuned: The next Kid of the Year special will air in February. Who will it be?
Gitanjali Rao, 16

Gitanjali’s schedule got even busier after she was named the 2020 TIME Kid of the Year. As a TFK Kid Reporter, she guest-edited our 2020 best-inventions list. She continues to hold innovation workshops in partnership with global organizations. The workshops “have reached 53,000 students across 27 countries,” Gitanjali told TFK.

Gitanjali also says she is continuing to “work on finding parasitic contaminants in water.” She’s an intern with the Colorado Department of Law. 
Tyler Gordon, 15

Tyler has worked with brands such as Disney and Foot Locker. In September 2021, he published a book of paintings. It’s called We Can: Portraits of Power. Tyler is also exploring the fashion world: He’s thinking about starting a clothing line.
As a TFK Kid Reporter, Tyler wrote about having talked to Kamala Harris in November 2020. Harris had just been elected vice president of the United States. She contacted Tyler after seeing a video of him painting her portrait. “I couldn’t believe I was actually talking to Kamala Harris,” he wrote. In December 2020, Tyler’s portrait of LeBron James appeared on TIME’s “Athlete of the Year” cover.
Ian McKenna, 17

Ian is a student at the University of Texas at Austin. (Above, he shows his college pride by making the hand sign for the Texas Longhorns.) This year, Ian says, “I’ve been fortunate to have been invited to speak with many organizations, including the Clinton Foundation’s educational programs.” He’s working with MadeGood foods. The goal is to bring young people together on global issues. And proceeds from a song written about him are going to a group that fights hunger.
“I’m so excited to have had this opportunity to raise awareness about hunger and food insecurity,” he says. 
Bellen Woodard, 11

Bellen started middle school this year. Her More than Peach crayons are for sale on Target’s website, and might soon be in the retailer’s stores. The crayons have also been featured at museums.

Keeping Kids Calm

Purrble comes to the rescue for anxious kids. This toy has seven sensors. They respond to touch. Purrble’s heartbeat speeds up when you play with the toy. Then you comfort Purrble by petting it. This slows its heartbeat down. It calms you too.

Offline Coding Class

Coding involves problem-solving. It also involves pattern recognition. Sphero indi teaches both. No screen is required. Kids as young as 4 use colored tiles to program a robotic car to move from point A to point B. Green tiles increase its speed. Pink tiles tell it to turn left. Purple tiles tell it to spin and dance. “We really wanted to take [coding] concepts and bring them into the physical world,” Jeff Wiencrot says. He’s one of the engineers who worked on the product. —By Chad de Guzman
Helping Hand

The Mega Cyborg Hand kit was created by Thames & Kosmos. It helps kids build a robotic hand that copies the movements of a real hand. You won’t find any wires, motors, or electronics. Instead, the device consists of plastic pieces and tubes filled with water. Once assembled and slipped on, it transmits force from the user’s fingers to the fingers of the robotic hand. The Mega Cyborg Hand can be adjusted to fit arms of almost any size. It easily switches from left-handed to right-handed to “claw.” —By Jared Lindzon

Fast and Futuristic

The XB-1 supersonic demonstrator is a 71-foot-long, faster-than-sound jet. It was developed by Boom Supersonic. The plane can achieve incredible speeds. It can cover the distance from New York City to London, in the United Kingdom, nearly twice as fast as a regular flight. And it can make that journey relying on sustainable aviation fuel. That’s a more eco-friendly alternative to fossil fuels. By 2029, the company hopes to be flying full-size planes that can carry 88 passengers. —By Jeffrey Kluger
Head Protector

In college and pro football games, offensive and defensive linemen crash helmets when the ball is snapped. So they sustain more than twice as many head impacts as players in other positions do. The Zero2 Trench, from Vicis, is the first position-specific helmet approved for in-game use in the pros. Engineers added a force-absorbing outer shell to the front of the helmet.

No pasta shape was good enough for Dan Pashman. The podcaster judges pasta on three factors. One is “sauceability,” or how sauce sticks to it. Another is “forkability,” or the ease of getting and keeping it on a fork. Last is “toothsinkability,” or how satisfying it is to eat. Pashman set out to create his dream shape. In March 2021, he and pasta company Sfoglini introduced Cascatelli. They have a half-tube shape to catch sauce. The ruffles provide a good bite. And they’re short, so they’re easily forked. Nearly 300,000 pounds of cascatelli have been sold. —By Eliana Dockterman
Portable Wheels

Andrea Mocellin is a former sports-car designer. He knows how to make things move fast. Now Mocellin is using his skills to build a better, more travel-friendly wheelchair. The Revolve Air has wheels with a hexagon structure. They are puncture-proof. And they fold up. This allows the chair to take up 60% less space than a standard folding wheelchair. Revolve Air fits in an airplane’s overhead compartment. Mocellin aims to get it out by mid-2022. He has nearly 12,000 customers on his waiting list. —By Jesse Will

Scientists in South Africa have reported a new variant of the virus that causes COVID-19. It’s called Omicron. It has since been found in other parts of the world. Countries have restricted travel from South Africa and other African nations. This is to slow the virus’s spread.
COVID-19 is “not done with us,” Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus says. He’s director-general of the World Health Organization. The agency calls Omicron a “variant of concern.” 
Omicron could spread more easily than other versions of the virus. Current vaccines might be less effective against it. Still, it’s likely they’ll protect against severe illness and death. Vaccine makers Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna say they can make changes to their shots if necessary.
The first known case in the United States was reported on December 1. Two days before, President Joe Biden gave a speech. He said Omicron is “not a cause for panic.” He urged people to get vaccinated.

The province of Quebec, in Canada, typically produces 70% of the world’s maple syrup. This year, the harvest fell short. So in November, Quebec Maple Syrup Producers said they would release 50 million pounds of the sweet stuff from their reserves. That’s half of what the group kept on hand to control supply.
In 2021, global demand for syrup went up. It increased by 21% from the previous year. “The pandemic helped, in our case,” spokesperson Hélène Normandin told Bloomberg. “We’re seeing people cook more at home.”
There are 50 million taps in Quebec. They drain sap from maple trees. That sap is used to make syrup. The plan is to add 7 million taps. This will be done over the next few years. “We need to produce more maple syrup,” Normandin says.

104,104,TFK Sits Down with Janet Yellen,"{'United States', 'Government'}","
Janet Yellen is the 78th United States secretary of the treasury. TFK Kid Reporter David Murtagh interviewed her in Washington, D.C.  

1. Could you explain what the U.S. Treasury does?
The Treasury department is concerned with making sure that the U.S. economy does well and that our financial system works.
2. What is inflation?
Inflation is the rate at which the prices of goods and services rise over a year. For a long time, inflation was low. The pandemic changed that. The [high] inflation we’re seeing now results from an economy that’s coming back after an enormous shock. I think it’ll go away over the next year.
3. TFK Kid Reporter Orlie asks, “What long-term effects will the pandemic have on the economy?”
We don’t know yet. One thing we do know is that the world has become more exposed to pandemic-type illnesses. This has opened people’s eyes to the need to be prepared. So there’s a big effort to improve our preparations for things that might happen in the future.
4. TFK Kid Reporter Lauryn asks, “What are green jobs?” 
When people use the term green jobs, they mean jobs that address climate change. Green jobs are those involved in activities that will replace fossil-fuel-burning electricity and cars that use gas.
5. TFK Kid Reporter Tabitha asks, “What role does the Treasury play in expanding the use of solar energy?”
The Treasury helps write the nation’s tax laws. Tax policy can be used to support an activity we want. A bill is working its way through Congress now that contains  for solar power.
6. TFK Kid Reporter Creedence says, “Our nation has debt. What can we do to get rid of it?”
I don’t think we have to get rid of it. It’s not a terrible thing for a country to have debt, as long as the debt is manageable.
7. What is cryptocurrency?
Cryptocurrency is an invented currency or  held in electronic form. We want to make sure they’re safe. Some of them promise that they’ll have a stable value relative to the dollar. We’ve been trying to have Congress make rules to make sure these do maintain their value.
8. What’s your favorite part of your job?
I have terrific colleagues.

106,106,At the Movies: Sing 2,"{'Movies and Television', 'Time Off'}","
The band is back together! Sing 2 showcases the crew of lovable animals from the 2016 animated musical Sing. And it adds a notable new character. Clay Calloway is a lion who’s a famous musician. He’s voiced by Bono, the lead singer of the rock band U2. 
Overseeing the magic of Sing 2 is Garth Jennings. He wrote and directed the film. When I spoke to Jennings, he told me he was delighted when Bono agreed to be part of it. “He’d seen the first film and really liked it,” Jennings told me. “He has a very passionate view of music and how important it is. And he loved being part of the fabric of this story.”
Much like the original, this movie is full of songs that will make audiences want to join in. In Sing 2, the talented animals are again led by Buster Moon. Buster is a koala who dreams of being a director. 
Jennings told me he has a special connection with Buster. “Buster is the character most like me,” he says. “He really believes in trying to make something wonderful, something worth dedicating your life to.”
In the movie, Buster and his animal performers work to impress a tough entertainment boss. They put on a glitzy theatrical production that’s out of this world. (It’s a musical set in outer space.) 
Speaking of outer space, Jennings told me he first dreamed about making movies after seeing Star Wars. That was when he was 5 years old. 
What’s the theme of  Sing 2? Never give up on your dreams. “It’s important that you go for it,” Jennings says. “That you fulfill your potential, whatever your potential is.”
Sing 2 is set to arrive in movie theaters this month, on December 22.

107,107,The Best Toys of 2021,"{'Culture', 'Time Off'}","

The best toys of 2021 might make for a magical holiday season. With Magic Mixies, mix up a potion and—poof!—summon a new stuffed pet. With Lego Vidiyo Party, create a music video in real time, wherever you are, with the power of virtual reality. And the Spirograph Animator reinvents a classic toy. It uses a light show to add animated effects to spiral designs. The editors of TIME for Kids have rounded up the best toys of the year for you. 

Work Your Magic

Magic comes alive with these toys. The Magic Mixies Magic Cauldron, from Moose Toys, includes a spell book and everything you need to create a magic potion. Add ingredients to the cauldron and watch the mixture foam and bubble. Then wave a magic wand, say the magic words, and—presto!—a mist rises from the cauldron. When it clears, an adorable creature called a Mixie is revealed. The Got2Glow Fairy Finder, by WowWee, sends you on a search for more than 30 virtual fairies. They could be anywhere: in a bedroom, the garden, or the kitchen. Once the fairies have been safely placed in the electronic jar, you can “bond” with the magical creatures by feeding and hugging them. 

Say “Cheese!” 

This is no ordinary camera. Sure, it takes photos. But the VTech KidiZoom PrintCam also lets you add special effects, borders, and digital stickers to your snaps. When your selfie or portrait looks just right, hit the print button. A black-and-white version instantly ejects from the front of the camera. Use it to create comic strips. Or turn your photos into coloring pages. There’s also a video-record function and games built in.

All Your Marbles 

Put your scientific mind to work with one of these contraptions. The Marble Rush Ultimate Set, by VTech, sends marbles rolling along tracks and ramps, around a lighted cone, and out of a cannon. Color-coded parts make the paths easy to assemble. For even more-high flying fun, try the National Geographic Makeway Magnetic Marble Run. Magnetic pieces let you build marble runs on vertical surfaces, like whiteboards and refrigerators. The set comes with a learning guide. It explores scientific concepts such as energy, gravity, and Newton’s laws of motion. 

Code and Create

Get creative with the Artie Max robot, from Educational Insights. This toy lets you create art while you learn to code. Artie Max helps you learn five basic coding languages: Blockly, Snap!, JavaScript, Python, and C++. Then, write code to tell Artie what to draw. The robot translates the code onto paper, using sensors and line recognition to create designs. 

Family Game Night

Quick! What’s an item you find at a grocery store? Good! Now name another. Hurry! When playing GibGab, from Fat Brain Toys, thinking and speaking faster than your opponent is key. Face an opponent across the electronic game board. Choose a category from one of the cards. Press a button, and you’re in a head-to-head battle. GibGab is great as a two-player game. Or gather friends for tournament-style play. The Disney Pixar Toy Story Talent Show, from Funko Games, brings beloved characters from the movies to family game night. In this super-active game, players show off their skills in a series of challenges. Complete the challenges to win prize tickets. Collect the highest number of prize-ticket points to win. 

Moments of Mindfulness

Does a calming, screen-free activity sound nice? These tactile toys focus your attention and soothe your senses. With Mindful Maze boards from Hand2mind, use your fingers to move through various patterns, including waves, rainbows, and stars. Pace your breathing to each task. Dimpl Pops, by Fat Brain Toys, offer a different satisfaction. The pop of colorful bubbles is as fun as it is relaxing.

High-Tech

These two toys transform screen time with technology. With Bill Nye as your guide, you’ll be transported to outer space to explore black holes, the cosmos, and more than 125 other immersive experiences. Bill Nye’s VR Space Lab, from Abacus Brands, comes with VR goggles and a 96-page activity book that they bring to life. There are also materials to build a planetarium and do 30 hands-on experiments. With the Lego Vidiyo app, create your own music videos. Just download the app, scan your Lego figurine, and create a video that will take place in augmented reality, wherever you are. The Party Llama BeatBox set comes with a scanning stage, a Party Llama figurine, and 16 BeatBits. Each BeatBit is used to create a different video effect in the app. 

Up for Grabs

Candy Claw Machine, from Thames & Kosmos, puts a spin on the classic arcade game. This do-it-yourself kit lets you build and engineer your own claw machine. Use gears, cranks, belts, and levers to make it work. Then add your favorite treats and practice reaching for prizes. The set also comes with three interchangeable claw types you can use to scoop and score.

Updated Classics

These classic toys, both from PlayMonster, are revamped for your generation. The Koosh Sharp Shot game puts a spin on soft and squishy Koosh balls, which were all the rage in the late ’80s and ’90s. In this slingshot game, they’re used to test a player’s aim. The Spirograph Animator is a modern twist on the original Spirograph. It was introduced in 1965 and lets you create detailed geometric drawings. The Spirograph Animator takes the fun a step further: Once you create your designs, set them on the animator. It will spin the drawings and start a light show. This creates an animated effect.

Bring It to Life

These kits take you behind the scenes to learn about video-game design and development. Nintendo’s Game Builder Garage, which can be played on Nintendo Switch systems, provides interactive lessons in programming and design. It guides you as you build seven games, from a thrilling car race to a challenging maze. Once you’ve learned the basics, you can create almost any game you can dream up. BitOGenius Inc.’s Pixicade Mobile Game Maker is perfect for art lovers. It comes with paper and five washable markers. Use them to draw your own game. After you use the Pixicade app to snap a photo of your work, it’s transformed into an animated game. The game can be played on a smartphone or tablet. 

From 2D to 3D

Keep your hands busy with Cubles. The toys are made from 100% recyclable paperboard. They’re part puzzle and part origami. To create a Cuble, pop out shapes from the paperboard and follow color-coded instructional tabs. Pieces fit together to make a three-dimensional toy. Cubles become a variety of creatures, including dinosaurs, dragons, and unicorns. They also turn into characters from beloved children’s book series, such as Little House on the Prairie and Dog Man. Cubles are small and don’t use scissors or glue. That makes them the perfect toy for holiday road trips.

108,108,TFK Sits Down with Dr. Rochelle Walensky,"{'People', 'Health'}","
We’ve heard a lot about the CDC—the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in Atlanta, Georgia. It has given us news, recommendations, and updates as our understanding of COVID-19 has evolved. Last week, I had the opportunity to meet the woman who leads the organization: Dr. Rochelle Walensky.
At first, I was very nervous to talk to the director of the CDC. But as soon as I walked up to Dr. Walensky, all that fear melted away. She was relaxed and friendly. Despite her packed day, she was full of energy. During the interview, I learned so much. And I appreciated Dr. Walensky’s clear explanations. I even got to sit in her chair in her conference room!

109,109,The Storyteller,"{'Environment', 'People'}","
When Jane Goodall was 6, she was often woken by sirens. That was during World War II.  The sirens warned that enemy planes were flying over her English town. Her sister would run to the bomb shelter. But Goodall refused. “I did not want to leave my bed,” she says.
That same stubbornness led her to become the world’s best-known . In 1960, she sat for months in the forests of Tanzania, in Africa. She waited for chimpanzees to accept her. When they did, Goodall observed them up close. She discovered that they use tools. 

In 1962, professors criticized Goodall for using human names and emotions to describe chimps. “I just quietly went on doing what I knew was right,” she says. Her belief that chimps are intelligent animals is now widely accepted.
In 1986, Goodall went to a meeting about habitat loss. The meeting changed her ideas about nature. Just doing research would no longer be enough. Goodall began a schedule of travel, charity work, and activism. After 35 years, she’s still on the job.
Telling Her Story
Goodall shares her life story to get people excited about the environment. “You’ve got to reach the heart,” she says. “I do that through storytelling.”

Before the pandemic, she traveled 300 days a year. She spoke to school assemblies, at conferences, and on talk shows. March 2020 saw COVID-19 shutdowns. Goodall ended her travels. For the past year and a half, she has spent hours each day doing virtual lectures and interviews. Her stories leave audiences feeling hopeful about our planet.
Staying Hopeful
Goodall promotes the idea that “everyone can do their bit.” Critics say that to make a difference, big changes are needed from businesses and governments. Kumi Naidoo is a South African activist. He says Goodall was “ahead of her time” on raising awareness. But, he adds, “All of us in the environmental movement . . . must acknowledge that . . . we have not delivered the results we set out to deliver.” This has led younger activists to take up more- strategies, such as school strikes.

Still, many claim Goodall as an inspiration (see “Roots & Shoots”). Vanessa Nakate is a 24-year-old activist. She says Goodall taught her “that protecting our ecosystems is so important.”
On October 31, world leaders gathered for a two-week climate conference. Many young activists fear the conference won’t lead to enough action. But Goodall is determined to find hope. “I won’t say I’m optimistic. But I have all my fingers crossed,” she says. “The positive thing is that there’s so much more awareness.” 

Roots & Shoots
Goodall started the youth-activism program Roots & Shoots. That was in 1991. Today, it has groups in more than 60 countries. According to the Jane Goodall Institute, at least 100,000 kids and teens are running more than 5,800 community projects. They support people, animals, and the planet. Goodall says it’s important for young people to keep the “hope that your actions can make a difference.”

Note: Jane Goodall and the Jane Goodall Institute do not endorse handling or close proximity to wildlife.

Government officials from 196 countries gathered for the United Nations Conference of the Parties. It was held in Glasgow, Scotland. It took place from October 31 to November 12. The conference brings world leaders together every year. They discuss how to address climate change. 
Officials had several goals. One was to figure out how to limit the rise in global temperatures. Scientists warn of more natural disasters if the planet gets much warmer.
More than 100 countries agreed to cut methane emissions by 30% in this decade. Methane is a planet-warming gas. More than 130 pledged to stop deforestation within that time. 
But many young people say promises are not enough. They want a formal agreement. They say it’s needed to make countries keep their promises. 
On November 6, about 100,000 people attended a rally in Glasgow. “Leaders keep praising young people for standing up and protesting,” Vanessa Nakate told TIME. Nakate is a climate activist from Uganda. “But saving the world needs decisions from leaders.”

About 25,000 athletes took part in the New York City Marathon, on November 7. It was the race’s 50th running. For many, the day felt like a comeback. Last year’s race was canceled because of the pandemic. 
This year, new steps were in place to keep people safe. Runners had to show proof of vaccination. Or they had to show proof of a negative COVID-19 test. Spectators were asked to practice social distancing.
People from 91 countries ran the race. Like all marathons, it is about 26 miles long. Albert Korir, from Kenya, won the men’s division. He finished in two hours, eight minutes, and 22 seconds. Kenya’s Peres Jepchirchir won the women’s division. She finished in two hours, 22 minutes, and 39 seconds. “It’s not easy,” she said of the New York course.

In our September 17 issue, we asked readers what part of space they’d like to explore. Mrs. Dami’s students, at Montgomery Elementary School, in Montgomery, New York, shared their thoughts. Read them below.
If you were a space explorer, where would you travel? What would you do there? Tell us at tfkeditors@time.com.

I want to explore black holes and come back successfully. I'll run experiments to see why light and people can’t escape and if there is a way to breach through a black hole. I would be nervous because I might not come back. And I’d be excited because if I do it I will be the first person to go into a black hole and come back out. —Alexander Carr, 9
I want to explore the universe so I can prove aliens are real. On the trip I will find a way to talk to the aliens. If I find them, I will learn from them. If I see them do things we can’t do, we can learn from them. I will be nervous and excited if they look creepy to us. We will be creepy to them so the being creepy is balanced. We are aliens. And if it backfires, we will still know we are not alone in the universe. —Jackson Cerdas, 9 
I would love to go to Mars. I have watched and learned so many things about space and the planets. My summer camp had a space day. I dressed up like an astronaut with a NASA shirt, white leggings, white shorts, a costume astronaut head, and sunglasses. I would do an experiment about gravity. I would bring a rabbit to see how high it can jump. I would bring  baking powder and soda and mix them together to see what it does. I also would squeeze a juice box and see what happens and if I can still drink it. —Jacklyn Grafer, 9
I would want to explore Saturn. It is really big and there's a lot to explore. Saturn is pretty cool because it has rings around it. If I were to run an experiment, I would run it on the surface of Saturn to see what type of land it is. I would experiment on any living things that are on Saturn. I would also do experiments with the air. What type of air does Saturn have? Nobody has ever been on Saturn. I wonder if it is different from Earth and what it would be like. —Andrew Carr, 9 
I would want to explore Jupiter because I would want to collect information about what it looks like. What would the colors look like? Would there be any twisters in action? Would there be life on the planet and could astronauts explore it? I would experiment with what Jupiter is made of. Would it be made of rock or made of sand? Would it be made of anything else? I hope this mission will happen one day. —Elise Gaina, 10
I would like to explore Mars. I would travel with a space monkey because monkeys are cute and would be fun to fly around with in zero gravity. Two experiments I would like to attempt are setting off fireworks and hitting a golf ball. For the fireworks I would call on the help of the people that do Fourth of July fireworks in New York City because they put on an amazing show. I’m not sure how hitting a golf ball will go but I am looking forward to finding out. —Jackson Pagan, 9
If I went to space I would see how fast I am on the moon. I would use time lapse on a timer to do it. I think I would be about two miles per hour if I was running on the moon, but I would have to test it then review the results. Another thing I would want to test is if I can stand up straight with almost no gravity. I think it is physically impossible to stand up straight with almost no gravity, but I would have to try it. It would be so fun if I could go to the moon one day! —Bodhi Smith, 9

In September, about 50 people gathered in Everett, Washington, to break ground for a new school building. Everett sits on the homeland of the Tulalip Tribes. The school board president  this. Members of the tribes then did a land blessing. “It was a very touching moment for us,” Chelsea Craig told TIME for Kids. She’s a Tulalip tribal member.


 
 
A growing number of schools and other groups are doing land acknowledgments. Events and gatherings begin with them. A land acknowledgment is a statement. It is meant to honor the Indigenous people who have traditionally lived in a certain area.
 
“It is part of our commitment to our community, to acknowledge the people who came before us,” Gerry Ebalaroza-Tunnell says. She’s director of equity for the Mukilteo School District.
 
Uplifting History
 
Land acknowledgment is becoming more common in the United States. Several U.S. cities have land acknowledgment statements. These include Tempe, Arizona; Eden Prairie, Minnesota; and Denver, Colorado. 
 
Land acknowledgment has also become part of popular culture. In Illinois, the Chicago Blackhawks ice-hockey team does a land acknowledgment before home games. In New York City, a land acknowledgment was done at the 2020 Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade. 
 
Brienne Colston is with the U.S. Department of Arts and Culture, or USDAC. (The group is not part of the U.S. government.) “Land acknowledgment is meant to uplift a history that’s been ignored,” Colston says. 


 
 
In 1855, the Tulalip Tribes’  gave up much of their land to the U.S. government. They moved to a reservation. This happened to other tribes, too. “For me, it’s about making the invisible visible,” Craig says of land acknowledgment.


 
 
At the event in September, Tulalip tribal members shared a traditional song. “When we began to sing, we could literally feel our ancestors with us,” Craig says. “It was very healing.”

The story ""On This Land""—about honoring Native land—appears in this week's issue of TIME for Kids. Nathan Whittinghill attends middle school in the Mukilteo School District, in Washington State. Here, he writes about what land acknowledgement means to him and what people can do to support Native communities.

Land acknowledgement is done in support of Native communities. I go to Voyager Middle School, in Everett, Washington. We have a land acknowledgement at the beginning of class. It’s a good first step toward honoring Native people. But if you really want to help, you can donate time and money. For example, the Native American Heritage Association provides food, clothing, and heating assistance. It helps people living on reservations in South Dakota and Wyoming. The American Indian College Fund gives financial assistance to Native students. The Seattle Indian Health Board hosts fundraisers to support Indigenous people here in the Puget Sound area. Acknowledging Native people requires more than a statement. It requires action.

Greg Heffley is the main character in Jeff Kinney’s Diary of a Wimpy Kid series of books. Greg is a middle school student. In his diary, he writes and draws pictures about his struggles to fit in. A live-action movie based on the first book, Diary of a Wimpy Kid, came out in 2010. Now an animated version is about to hit screens.
The new Diary of a Wimpy Kid “is going to feel a lot different than the live-action movie,” Kinney told TFK Kid Reporter Lucy Sandor. Parts of the original movie were reimagined. But the latest version “just came to life from the pages of the book,” he says. 
Humor inspires Kinney. When he writes, he likes to start with the jokes. “When I think of a joke, it often comes with a picture in my mind,” he says. “Then I write.” Diary of a Wimpy Kid will be available on Disney+ beginning December 3.

119,119,Sneak Peek: More Than Peach,"{'Books', 'Time Off'}","
Bellen Woodard is known as the world’s first crayon activist. In 2019, she started a brand of multicultural crayons called More than Peach. Last year, she was a top-five TIME Kid of the Year honoree, and she’s a 2021 TFK Kid Reporter. 
Now, Bellen has written a picture book called More than Peach, telling her story. It will be published on July 26, 2022. 
Bellen shared an exclusive first look at the cover of More than Peach with TIME For Kids readers. She also spoke with TFK about the book and the inspiration behind it. 

TIME for Kids: 
What does it mean to be a crayon activist? 
Bellen Woodard: 
To me, an activist is someone who's active in making change. And there’s no rule book for activism, which means you can do it your own way: There are no wrong answers. And that’s exactly what I’m doing. 

TFK: 
Why did you start More than Peach? 
Bellen:
When I was in third grade, I heard my classmates ask for the skin-color crayon, but I knew they actually meant the peach crayon. And I was kind of confused, because my skin isn’t peach. 

So that day, when I went home to my mom, I told her about what happened. And she was like, “Well, our skin color is brown. So next time they ask, just hand them a brown crayon.” But I didn't want to do that, because I knew that if I didn't like being handed the peach crayon, no one else would like being handed the brown crayon if it didn’t match them.

So instead, I told her, “No, next time, I’m going to ask what color they actually want.” Because there are any number of beautiful skin colors. And that’s exactly what I did. 

My teacher heard me do that, and she started doing it too. And then my whole class started, and then my whole school. And that’s when I decided I wanted to start my project. 

TFK: 
Can you tell us about your upcoming book?  
Bellen:
I’m really excited about the book. I tell my story. It’s about youth leadership, empathy, and creativity. I hope that when kids look at the book, they can see people who look like them. 

TFK: 
What do you hope readers take away from your story? 
Bellen:
I hope it inspires kids to make changes—and not just in their classrooms but in the world.

A zoo may be the only chance any of us will get to see an Asian elephant. There are about 50,000 of them left in the wild. Every year, there are fewer. 

But Happy is lonely at the zoo, says the Nonhuman Rights Project (NhRP). It’s an animal-rights group. A fence separates Happy from Patty, another elephant. The NhRP is taking the Bronx Zoo to court. It wants Happy moved to a . She’ll have contact with other elephants there.
Steven Wise is the NhRP president. “We understand what [Happy’s] life means to her,” he says, “which is almost nothing at all.”

On the Case
The NhRP’s case against the Bronx Zoo is unusual. The group is relying on a legal order meant for humans. The order says a person who has been unlawfully imprisoned must be released. The NhRP will argue in court that Happy should have that same right.
There’s research to support that argument. In 2005, Happy became the first Asian elephant to pass a mirror test. This test is given to see if an animal can recognize itself, like a person does.
Experts say elephants thrive when they form social bonds. Joyce Poole studies elephants in Africa. Keeping one in a city is “a recipe for disaster,” she says. “As you can imagine, if you were locked behind bars, there’s not much to do.”

The Zoo’s View
The Bronx Zoo says Happy is well cared-for. And some people say removing her from the zoo would be a mistake. At zoos, kids can form a connection to elephants. “Our greatest hope is for people to want to protect and preserve these beautiful animals,” Jodi Gibson says. She’s president of the Zoological Society of Milwaukee.

According to the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA), some 55 million schoolchildren visited zoos each year before the coronavirus pandemic. Still, attitudes about zoos are changing.
In 2015, SeaWorld considered ending its killer-whale shows. The park had been criticized for keeping the creatures in captivity.

But zoos reach more people than any other group involved with . They’re more important than ever, AZA president Dan Ashe says. If there’s a time when children can no longer visit zoos and learn to care about elephants, he says, “It’ll come at a great cost.”
Other Court Cases
In 2014, the Supreme Court of India made waves. It said animal rights are protected under the nation’s constitution. When it banned a bullfighting festival, the court wrote that animals have the right to “live in a healthy and clean atmosphere.”
That same year, a court in Argentina ruled that an orangutan named Sandra (pictured) could be freed from a zoo. The ruling was later reversed. But Sandra was still moved to a sanctuary in Florida.

121,121,Dr. Janet Woodcock Talks with TIME for Kids,"{'People', 'Health'}","
On October 29, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorized emergency use of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine for children 5 to 11 years old. Kids across the U.S. are already getting their first dose. 
I spoke with Dr. Janet Woodcock, the acting commissioner of the FDA. She’s responsible for making sure everything at the FDA runs smoothly as the agency tests the safety and effectiveness of vaccines.
I learned about the COVID-19 vaccine trials for kids and how the FDA studied vaccine safety. We talked about how getting kids vaccinated against COVID-19 could help end the pandemic. And I got to thank Dr. Woodcock for studying and authorizing the COVID-19 vaccine. 
Read my questions and Dr. Woodcock’s answers below.

TFK Kid Reporter Via Ryerson:
What are your responsibilities as the acting FDA commissioner?
Dr. Janet Woodcock:
I’m in charge of making sure that everything runs at the FDA correctly. The FDA is in charge of all medical products—like drugs, testing vaccines, blood and biological products—as well as food and cosmetics, feed for animals, and animal medications. So it’s a lot of different activities and different commodities. We make sure they’re safe and that they work.
Via:
So the big news this week is that the FDA authorized emergency use of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine for kids 5 to 11. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) then said that shots can begin as early as this week. I’ve waited for months to get vaccinated so this is big news to me and other 5- to 11-year-old kids and their parents. What does it mean that the FDA authorized “emergency use”?
Dr. Woodcock:
“Emergency use” is a special [authority] we have, that Congress provided, for when you have a public health emergency like we do with the pandemic. It’s to get things out quickly, but with the same level of scrutiny, of carefulness, that we would [use] for a regular approval. We looked at the data on the pediatric vaccine. We looked at safety. We looked at the effectiveness. We had an advisory committee meeting and got expert input. And those advisers voted very, very positively that kids this age should get the vaccine.
Via:
What research was needed to figure out if this COVID-19 vaccine was safe for kids?
Dr. Woodcock:
First of all, there was a large number of adults who were given the vaccine or a placebo [a shot with no active medicine in it], to see whether or not it protected against the virus and what side effects occurred. And it was found that it did protect very well against the virus. And that was later moved down to teenagers. But in kids, we needed a lower dose. And so a lower dose was devised. Then that was tested in thousands of kids, compared to a placebo. And it was shown what the side effects were, and that it was over 90% effective in preventing kids 5 to 11 from getting COVID-symptomatic disease.
Via:
The vaccine had to be approved by both the FDA and the CDC. Does the FDA have different priorities for studying the COVID-19 vaccine than the CDC [does]?
Dr. Woodcock:
Well, the FDA and the CDC have different roles. The FDA works with the people who make the vaccine and who develop it and test it. We set the rules for how these experimental products are studied until they’re authorized or approved. And that’s true for medicines, as well. Now, the CDC works on what are called “immunization practices.” And so they're looking at the population as a whole and all the vaccines kids are getting. As you know, kids get a fair number of vaccines to protect them against a wide range of childhood illnesses. And so the CDC works on that. 
In this special circumstance where we’re doing this emergency-use authorization, the FDA has a role. We have to authorize. That makes the vaccine available. And then the CDC has to recommend the use. That makes the government able to distribute the vaccine to people.
Via:
Why did the FDA work on approving adult vaccines before approving children's vaccines?
Dr. Woodcock:
That’s a common way to develop vaccines for diseases that affect adults as well as kids. And in this case, adults are the worst-affected by COVID-19. The older you are, the more at risk you are. People in nursing homes and older adults were at the highest risk of hospitalization and even death from the disease. So it made sense to test these vaccines first in the adult population. 
But also, remember: Vaccines, unlike many treatments and medicines, are given to healthy people to prevent something. And so for vaccines, it's really important to do no harm, to make sure that these are very safe. Before we go down into the younger age groups, we want to test them in adults and make sure they're safe.
Via:
What side effects should kids expect after getting the first and second doses of the vaccine?
Dr. Woodcock:
The most common side effect you might have is a sore arm right after your shot. Some kids might feel like they have a mild flu. For a day after, they might feel tired, have a little fever and chills, perhaps a headache. Symptoms like that. But usually, these are gone within a day or so.
Via:
What’s the biggest challenge of working on approving the vaccines for kids?
Dr. Woodcock:
It’s challenging to get kid volunteers and do studies in children. Like most people, children don't want to be stuck with needles and have their blood drawn and so forth. But we got trial volunteers, and those kinds of tests were done. 
One of the challenges, I think, is that some people are very concerned or hesitant about vaccines and are reluctant to take them. And that's even more common as it comes to children compared to adults. And so you have to really assure yourself of the safety of these, and that you are evaluating them very carefully to make sure you understand what the side effects might be.
Via:
Will getting kids vaccinated against COVID-19 help end the pandemic?
Dr. Woodcock:
Likely that is so. We don't yet know enough about this disease, this virus, to say what we need to do [to end the pandemic]. But we know one thing is to have a large [part] of the population no longer getting sick and going around and spreading the disease. We don’t know yet how much vaccination prevents transmission. People might still acquire the virus and be able to spread it to other people. But we do believe a high level of vaccination will help in this pandemic, and that people should be protected down to young ages.
Via:
Where can kids and families get information about the vaccine?
Dr. Woodcock:
The CDC provides, on their web page, a lot of information for people who want to know about the vaccines. That's a good starting source because it's very reliable. And the FDA also has information that you can look at. 
Via:
How will the FDA make sure everyone can get the vaccine?
Dr. Woodcock:
It will be available in pediatricians’ offices and at primary care, for those who have a pediatrician or primary care doctors. But unfortunately, there are a lot of kids who don't have that kind of care. So there will be different clinics and also pharmacies that will be offering vaccination. And there will be other attempts to try to make sure that any kid whose parent or guardian wants to get them vaccinated has an opportunity to [do so].
Via:
Thank you so much for your hard work keeping kids safe during the pandemic, and thank you for studying the vaccine.
Dr. Woodcock:
Most welcome. It's my pleasure to talk to you.

122,122,Dr. Vivek Murthy Talks with TIME for Kids,"{'People', 'Health'}","
On November 3, the day after Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine was approved for kids ages 5 to 11, I had a chance to speak with the United States surgeon general, Dr. Vivek Murthy.
The surgeon general oversees the U.S. Public Health Service, and is the country’s top doctor. I asked him questions about his job, the vaccine, and what kids need to know about staying healthy. I learned that reaching out to friends who might be feeling lonely and anxious about getting back to school this year can be good for all of us.

TFK Kid Reporter Lucy Sandor:
My first question is pretty simple. What is a surgeon general?
Dr. Vivek Murthy:
The surgeon general has two jobs. And it’s important to note that surgeon general is a position that’s been around for more than 100 years in the government. This is an individual who is charged with, number one, making sure that people all over the country have access to good, accurate information based on science, so they can make good decisions for themselves and their families about their health. And the second role of the surgeon general is to oversee one of the eight uniformed services in the U.S. government. So, you’re probably familiar with the Army, the Navy, the Air Force . . . . Well, one of the other uniformed services we have is the Public Health Service Commissioned Corps. These officers—there are about 6,000 of them; they include doctors and nurses and pharmacists—they go all over the country, and sometimes around the world, helping people when there’s a health crisis. 
So that’s what the surgeon general does. And the most important job the surgeon general has is to make sure that he or she is doing everything possible to help people around our country stay healthy and safe.
Lucy: 
Thanks for explaining. We have been hearing Dr. [Anthony] Fauci’s name a lot in the past year. And we hear your name sometimes in the news, too. What’s the difference?
Dr. Murthy: 
Well, that’s a good question. There are thankfully a number of us in government who are scientists and doctors and public-health experts who are trying to work on the pandemic and communicate with the public so people know how to keep themselves safe. Dr. Fauci has been doing this for many, many years. The surgeon general also does this. The CDC [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] director is an important voice here, too. 
So there are a lot of us working closely together. We talk often. We all speak in as many channels as we can to people, because in this moment when you’ve got to reach millions and millions of people across the country, having more than one voice is really helpful.
Lucy: 
That makes sense. Now, what’s your favorite part of your job?
Dr. Murthy: 
I’m actually doing it right now. It’s having a chance to talk to young people across the country, to hear about what’s on their mind and to understand what kinds of questions they have. That’s really my favorite part of my job. I have two kids myself. They’re 5 and 3. They ask me plenty of questions about COVID-19.
Lucy: 
Next, I'm going to ask some questions about health and for your advice. I’m 11, and I’m really looking forward to getting my COVID vaccine. Some of my friends are worried and a little afraid, though. Is there any advice you have for them?
Dr. Murthy: 
This is what I would say to your friends, Lucy, and what I hope that all young people and parents understand about the vaccine for kids. Number one, these vaccines were approached really, really carefully. They were studied in clinical trials, which are scientific studies that involved thousands of young people in the 5-to-11 age range. And [the studies] found two important things. One was that the vaccines were really effective at preventing young people from getting COVID. In fact, they were more than 90% effective—which, as far as vaccines go, is really, really high. The second thing they found is that the safety profile of these vaccines was really, really good. When people did experience a side effect, it tended to be something like soreness in the arm where they got their shot, or some redness or swelling in the arm, or some fatigue. But all those symptoms went away pretty quickly. And what [people] were left with was protection against the virus.
Here’s a thing I should tell you, Lucy, which is important for everyone to know. There’s also a risk of not getting vaccinated and getting COVID, right? Because what we’ve seen over the past year and a half is that the virus does have serious consequences in some young people. There have been, unfortunately, thousands of kids who have had to be hospitalized because of COVID. And there are also some symptoms—like shortness of breath, fatigue, tiredness—that can last for weeks or months after you get COVID.
So what I really want people to know is that [the vaccine] went through a careful process of study. The Food and Drug Administration, which looks carefully at any new medicine or vaccine, as well as the CDC, which has an important role in that too, have held this vaccine to the same high standards [to which] they would hold any other vaccine to make sure that it is both effective and safe for our kids.
Lucy:
That’s great advice. Thank you. 
I know that you’ve done a lot of research on loneliness and how it negatively impacts adults’ health. Do you think it affects kids the same way?
Dr. Murthy:
I do worry a lot about loneliness, because a lot of people experience it, including young people. And I do think it has a negative effect on our health—not just our physical health, but also our mental health. And we’ve seen in many people, over the years, that anxiety and depression and other health challenges can increase in likelihood when you’re struggling with loneliness for a long period of time. 
So I think it’s really important that we talk about loneliness. Because if you are feeling lonely, if you’re feeling isolated, it doesn’t mean that something’s wrong with you. It doesn’t mean that you’re a loser, or that you’re flawed in some way. It’s a very normal part of the human experience, and a lot of people feel lonely. Now, it doesn’t always look like that from the outside. So you can’t always judge, based on how many parties somebody is going to or how many friends they seem to have, whether they’re lonely or not. A lot of people are going to parties, or surrounded by a lot of friends, or have a lot of followers on social media, but are really alone.
So what’s important is that we recognize that each of us has a really powerful role that we can play in one  another’s life simply by being a friend, by showing up and being present, by caring about somebody else, by listening to them when they’re having a hard time. That’s how we can help each other. And that’s why I always want people to remember that you don’t have to be a doctor or a nurse in order to be a healer, right? A healer is somebody who helps make other people’s health and well-being better. You can do that by being a good friend, by being a good family member, and by simply showing up for people in your life.
Lucy:
Thank you. That was very helpful. 
Is there anything else that you think we should know that I didn’t ask you today?
Dr. Murthy:
Lucy, I’m so glad that you’re doing this, first of all, because it’s so important for young people to hear from other young people, and for young people to have a voice when it comes to how we deal with this pandemic. And it’s been a really tough pandemic. 
There are a couple of things I just want to make sure that we convey to young people, as I know that this pandemic has been tough on everyone, and going through school has been hard during the pandemic for so many kids. You know, figuring out when this is going to end has been the big question everyone’s been worrying about and wondering about. 
But I do want people to know that we’re making a lot of progress. We have 190 million people in our country who are now protected against COVID because they’ve been fully vaccinated. That’s a big deal. And now that we have a vaccine for kids under 12 years old, 28 million more people in our country will have a chance to get vaccinated and protected. But during this time, when we’re getting through the pandemic, there will be better days ahead. I want people to know that. 
We will get back to a sense of normal. The way that we’re going to get there best is not only if we make sure folks get protected and vaccinated, but if we make sure that we support people in our lives during these hard times. You know, none of us can get through this alone. And if COVID has taught us anything, it’s that we really do need each other, and we do better when we take care of one another. So let’s just remember that this is a time when being kind and being compassionate to one another are more important than ever before. They’re what’s going to make this pandemic much easier for us all to get through.
Lucy: 
Thanks so much for talking to TIME for Kids today, Dr. Murthy.
Dr. Murthy:
Of course. Thanks, Lucy, for having this conversation. I really enjoyed it.

124,124,Should Zoos Still Exist?,"{'Debate', 'Opinion'}","
Happy is an Asian elephant. She lives at the Bronx Zoo, in New York City. But the Nonhuman Rights Project (NhRP) says the zoo doesn’t give Happy the space and socialization she needs. The NhRP is taking the Bronx Zoo to court. The case will be heard next year. It has restarted talks about whether zoos should still exist. Some say zoos save species from extinction. Others argue that living in captivity is bad for an animal’s health. Here, TIME for Kids readers weigh in. 

Grace Hipp, 8
Nashville, Tennessee
Many animal species are saved from extinction thanks to zoos. This past summer, I saw the California condor at the San Diego Zoo and learned about the breeding program there. Several decades ago, these vultures were almost wiped out in the wild. But the zoo has taken some of them in and helped them breed. Now there are many more California condors.

Yanni Warrenson, 12
San Francisco, California
We shouldn’t have zoos. In zoos, animals might not be given proper living conditions. They might also be mistreated. Animals can feel stressed by cage restraint, an unfamiliar environment, and the presence of humans. A 2003 study of 35 species of carnivores found that zoo enclosures were too small for some of the animals to carry out their normal routines.

Shane Madrak, 10
Foster City, California
We should still have zoos for a few reasons. Zoos provide animals with food and a habitat that is made to look like their natural habitat. Zoos also breed animals to increase their population. And most zoos have educational programs that help children learn about different animals and conservation efforts. 

Susie Slawsky, 9
Pelham, New York 
Animals are kept away from their homes and put in fenced areas or cages. If it’s a crowded day at the zoo, some animals might get overwhelmed. When they’re in zoos, they can also lose their natural instincts. If they were released into the wild, they wouldn’t know how to survive. An animal’s health is more important than our entertainment.

In January, eight gorillas at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park, in California, became the first great apes to test positive for COVID-19.  “There was immediate concern,” Nadine Lamberski told TIME for Kids. She’s the chief conservation and wildlife health officer at the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance. “We wanted to take all precautions to make sure that didn’t happen again.”
So Lamberski made a decision. In February, she gave nine other great apes an  COVID-19 vaccine. They were the first zoo animals in the United States to get one. Since then, shots have been shipped out to zoo animals in 27 states.

Reducing Risk
Lamberski got the COVID-19 vaccine from Zoetis. The company makes medications for animals. Scientists there produced a COVID-19 vaccine in 2020. They made it for dogs and cats. Now the company says its vaccine is safe for other animals.
Zoos are requesting the Zoetis vaccine. They say their animals could contract the virus from visitors and caretakers. “Animals in zoos are exposed to hundreds, if not thousands, of people a day,” Lamberski says.
Getting Their Shot
How do caretakers get animals to stay still for a vaccine? “We  the animal,” Michael Adkesson says. He’s the president and CEO of the Chicago Zoological Society. That group manages the Brookfield Zoo, in Illinois. 
First, an animal is poked with a finger in the back of the leg. The action is repeated with a pointy object, like a pen. This is followed by a poke with a syringe. It doesn’t have a sharp needle. Eventually, an animal sits still to get the shot. And when it does, it gets a treat.
Animals at the San Diego Zoo are rewarded too. “Our lions and tigers get bloodsicles,” Lamberski says. “That’s frozen blood and meat juices. They really like those!”

128,128,TFK Explains: COVID-19 Vaccine for Kids,"{'Science', 'Health'}","
On November 2, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for children ages 5 to 11. This vaccine helps protect against COVID-19. Here’s what you need to know. 
How does the vaccine work?
The vaccine works to boost the body’s immunity to COVID-19. It uses something called mRNA technology. The m is for messenger. The vaccine teaches cells in your body how to attack the virus that causes COVID-19.  
Will children get the same dose that adults and people ages 12 to 17 get?
No. The dose for kids ages 5 to 11 is smaller. But to be fully vaccinated, anyone who gets the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine needs two doses, given three weeks apart. 
Are the vaccine side effects for kids ages 5 to 11 similar to those that other age groups might experience?
So far, yes. Some people who get the vaccine might experience fever, chills, and headache. They might also feel tired and have muscle pain. These might be signs that your immune system is working. They could last one to three days after the shot. In very rare cases, people get more-serious side effects that involve the heart. Some people experience no side effects.
Do I need to wear a mask if I’m fully vaccinated? 
The CDC recommends that people who are vaccinated wear a mask indoors in places where COVID-19 is spreading at a high rate. At press time, that was the case in 73% of the U.S. The CDC also says people should follow masking rules set by state and local governments.
Don’t children have a lower risk of getting a serious case of COVID-19 than adults?
Yes. But unvaccinated children can still spread the virus to people who are at greater risk for severe illness. Plus, the highly contagious Delta variant of the virus is sending more children to the hospital than early forms of the virus did.  
Why did it take so long for kids ages 5 to 11 to be able to get the COVID-19 vaccine?
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed the scientific data to make sure the vaccine was safe and effective for kids in this age group. Once the FDA gave its authorization for emergency use, on October 29, the CDC had to review the FDA decision.
Will vaccinating kids help control the pandemic?
Yes. There are 28 million kids in the U.S. ages 5 to 11. The government says it has enough vaccine for everyone in this age group. This will help stop the spread of the disease.

129,129,Anchor on the Road,"{'People', 'Media Literacy'}","
Lester Holt is an award-winning journalist. Since 2015, he has anchored Nightly News on NBC. In 2020, he launched a digital edition of the show for kids. That show’s guests have included Dr. Anthony Fauci and JoJo Siwa.
On October 20, TFK Kid Reporter Ethan Zhang spoke with Holt, who’s about to embark on his sixth Across America tour. Traveling to report on stories “helps us be a better newscast,” Holt told Ethan. “We’re going to talk about how a lot of people have moved during the pandemic to different cities that have new opportunities.” Read the conversation below. 
Ethan will catch up with Holt in person on the Across America tour. Watch them online on a special edition of NBC’s Nightly News: Kids Edition, on November 4 at 4 p.m. ET.

TFK Kid Reporter Ethan Zhang: 
I understand that you have taken NBC’s Nightly News on the road in the past few years and visited many cities, including, this year, Orlando, Cleveland, and Seattle. Can you tell us what motivates you to go on tour, especially this year?
Lester Holt:
Sure. You know, we are a national broadcast, meaning that we’re seen all across the country. We do Across America as a way of touching base with people in different parts of the country, to hear some of the stories that are important to people in those communities. It helps us be a better newscast that really reflects the country as a whole and not just the New York area, where we’re based.
Ethan:
Thank you. What was your most memorable moment from the last tour?
Holt:
I believe it was in Pittsburgh. A young girl—she was probably around your age—had prepared T-shirts with my name on them and big signs. She came out to watch the broadcast, and I was very touched. I’m always excited and pleased when I learn of young people, like yourself, who are really interested in news and really interested in the world around them.
Ethan:
What are you looking forward to reporting on this time?
Holt:
I think we’re going to talk about how a lot of people have moved during the pandemic to different cities that have new opportunities. We’re seeing what some people call a large migration of Americans moving to different parts of the country now. They’re kind of reinventing themselves as we’ve moved through this phase of the pandemic.
Ethan:
Can you tell us why you choose to leave the anchor desk sometimes and report on the road?
Holt:
The most important part of what we do is the work of reporters. Even though I’m the anchor of the program and you normally see me sitting behind a desk, in my heart, I’m a reporter. So when there’s a big, big story, we like to take the broadcast to the story. That's where I can do my best work in terms of digging up the facts and talking about how something may impact people. So I'm always eager, as big stories break, to evaluate whether we should go and whether we can make a big impact by our presence there.
Ethan:
I love road trips, but traveling during the pandemic must have been very different. How did you prepare for the tour?
Holt:
That's a really good question. Obviously, it’s important that we’re all tested [for COVID-19] before we go on the road. It’s very important that we start a trip healthy. I usually look at the latest data from communities we’re going to, to understand where they are right now in the COVID experience. I do a ton of research just in general. We have researchers on our staff who help prepare me with briefing information about the various cities we're going to: the population, the famous sites, what people like to do, what kind of food they like. All those things are really important to know before we get there for me to have a real understanding of the city and how people there see themselves.
Ethan:
I heard you have a cute dog named Lucy. Do you ever take her with you?
Holt:
I really wish I could. Lucy is an Australian Labradoodle. She’s very silly, and she loves to be around people. Unfortunately, I’m so busy when I get on the ground in various cities, it would be difficult to take her along. But, you know, maybe I will ask one day if there’s a way we can take her, because she’s fun to have around.
Ethan:
I know you are also a musician. Do you take your instrument with you?
Holt:
Sometimes, when I travel on long assignments, I do bring a bass guitar with me. It’s actually one that’s specially built for taking on the road. It’s a little bit smaller than a usual bass. I haven’t taken it on Across America. I have taken it, however, to the Olympics. Most recently, I was in Japan for the Summer Olympics, and I brought it. I played it on the airplane using my headphones, and I played it in my hotel room. So I think I’ll take it on this next trip. It’s a nice way to relax and wind down at the end of the day.
Ethan:
Very cool! I play drums. 
You’re a role model for many young reporters around the country. Can you share some advice for kid reporters?
Holt:
I think my most important advice to kids is to really become critical thinkers. We hear a lot of stuff every day, and it’s important to make sure you’re getting correct information. So that means you don’t accept everything right away. Somebody will tell you something wild and exciting, and if you just spend five or 10 minutes on the computer checking a trusted source, you might find the real truth and whether that story is accurate or not. Certainly as a journalist, you never want to give information that is not correct. The core of what we do is giving people facts every day. And that’s even a good practice for people who aren’t journalists—that they take a moment when they hear something extreme. It’s worth taking a few minutes to do some research and ask some hard questions, so that we make sure that when we share that story, we're sharing the truth.
Ethan:
That’s very good advice. I'll keep that in my mind.
Thank you for answering all my questions, Mr. Holt. I look forward to watching your tour on TV.
Holt:
You are very welcome. You’re a good journalist. Those were really good questions. 
Ethan:
Thank you.

130,130,Restoring Forests,"{'Environment', 'Science'}","
Aadya Joshi looks across a landscape near Mumbai, India. She sees eucalyptus trees. They were planted to replace a forest. It was cleared for timber. Joshi is not happy. Eucalyptus trees don’t grow naturally in the area, she says. Native trees should have been planted. Only they could bring back the biodiversity that once was there. (See “What Is Biodiversity?”) 
“You can’t plant something that doesn’t fit into an ecosystem and expect the ecosystem to function,” she told TIME for Kids. Joshi is the founder of The Right Green. The group teaches people about growing native trees.

Once, Earth was home to 6 trillion trees. Now there are about 3 trillion. Planting new trees to replace those that have been lost “sounds like a good idea,” Joshi says. “But what [people are] doing in many places is not restoring forests. They’re just replanting. There’s a big difference.” 
Replanting Problems
Trees are important to the health of the planet. They help clean the air. They’re also a source of food and medicine. But 46% of the world’s trees have been cut down. This is done for businesses such as cattle farming and paper making. 
Some efforts to replant trees make things worse. This happened in Chile, in South America. Big companies cut down forests for timber. They replanted in the 1970s using the wrong kinds of trees. They created tree plantations. “They’re not really what we imagine a forest to be,” Robert Heilmayr says. “These trees are more like a crop.” 

 
Heilmayr is a professor of environmental economics. He teaches at the University of California, Santa Barbara. He says tree plantations might make soil erosion worse. And they’re not as good as forests are at trapping carbon dioxide. This can make climate change worse.
Today, Chile’s government pays small landowners to plant native trees. Heilmayr says this kind of approach to forest restoration “is really productive.”
Restoration Done Right

 
Restoring native forests must benefit people, Bernadette Arakwiye says. She’s a researcher for the World Resources Institute (WRI) Forest Program in Africa. “People are a part of the environment,” she says. “We have to think both about the  of the land and human needs.” 
One WRI program aims to restore almost 400,000 square miles of African land by 2030. Some farmers are planting trees that help the soil retain moisture. This protects drinking water. 

 
Joshi says protecting food sources and protecting native species go hand-in-hand with fighting climate change. But it means planting the right trees. “We’ll only make [environmental problems] worse by planting things our  cannot survive on.""
What Is Biodiversity?

Biodiversity is the variety of living things in a habitat or ecosystem. An environment needs diversity to maintain balance. For example, insects carry pollen. Plants need pollen to make seeds. The seeds grow into plants that provide food for insects. Insects become food for frogs. You can help protect biodiversity. Learn about the plants and animals in your area. Join efforts to plant native trees and clean up rivers and parks.

135,135,Game On?,"{'Business', 'World'}","
During the pandemic, board games became an entertainment lifeline for people stuck at home. Demand for them is still high. But now, the industry is feeling the effects of a global shipping crisis. And this crisis is hitting some companies hard.
Board games sold in the United States are often made in other countries. Prices have skyrocketed for shipping containers and the space on ships needed to get products to the U.S. People are buying games, but there’s no way to get the games to customers, Maggie Clayton says. She’s director of sales and marketing for a company called Greater than Games. 

 
“We’ve had a container of our most popular game sitting in China since May,” she tells TIME. “We’re in this weird situation where there’s high demand for our products because of the increase in people playing games during the pandemic. But we just can’t get the product over here.”
State of Play
The value of the global games and puzzles market increased by nearly $1 billion in 2020, according to one research company. Hasbro is the company behind such classic games as Monopoly and Clue. It reported a game-sales jump of more than 20% last year.  
Anne-Marie De Witt is the CEO at Fireside Games. Its most popular product is Castle Panic. Last year, sales of that game jumped by around 20%. Then the shipping crisis hit. 

“We started hearing about shipping prices rising and rising,” says De Witt. Before the pandemic, she says, it cost about $5,000 to ship games in a 20-foot container. Now, she’s heard about companies paying $40,000 for a container of the same size. 
At Greater than Games, the most popular product is called Spirit Island. The company has raised the price of this game by around $10 to cover rising shipping costs. People have been willing to pay more for it. But Clayton is not so sure they’ll pay more for smaller games. 

“It’s going to be a tougher sell to convince people that a game that feels like it should be $20 is really worth $30,” she says. “It’s a business decision—and not even one that we want to be making,” Clayton says about the price increases. “It seems like a big, far-off thing when you say ‘global shipping crisis.’ But all industries are being affected by this in some way, shape, or form.”

139,139,Digital Art Boom,{'Arts'},"
Last year, Jazmine Boykins was posting her artwork online for free. It got lots of likes, shares, and comments. But it didn’t make much money. 
That has changed. Thanks to a new technology, Boykins has been selling the same art pieces for thousands of dollars as NFTs. That stands for non- tokens. These NFTs represent the digital art pieces. They come with a certificate of ownership and . This is a guarantee. It says that the person who buys the NFT is getting the original version.

Boykins sold more than $60,000 in NFT art in six months. “At first, I didn’t know if it was trustworthy or legit,” she told TIME. “But to see digital art being bought at these prices, it’s pretty astounding. It’s given me the courage to keep going.”
State of the Art
NFTs exist as computer files. Artists sign up with a digital marketplace. They list NFTs there for auction. It’s like selling things on eBay. 

NFTs are having a big moment. In September, people spent nearly $2 billion on them. In March, a digital artist sold an NFT for more than $69 million.
Some people are investing in NFTs to get rich. This is why critics call the NFT art craze a bubble. Prices may be high now, they say. But the bubble will burst. Then, artworks that once sold for high prices will lose much of their value.
But many artists have embraced the craze. They include authors, musicians, and filmmakers. They see a future in which NFTs have changed how people value art. 

“You will have so many people from different backgrounds and genres coming in to share their art, connect with people, and potentially build a career,” Boykins says.
Cashing In 
Artworks sold as NFTs can often be viewed online for free. That raises a question: Why would people pay so much money for something they can see for free?

The answer is that certificate of authenticity. This is what attracts some collectors. If they know an “authentic” version of something exists, they want it. Plus, some NFT collectors say they’re happy paying for the work of artists they like. 
 By selling NFTs, digital artists might now be able to make a good living from their work. And NFT artists are forming tight communities. Andrew Benson is an artist based in Los Angeles. “It really does seem like everyone could benefit,” he says.
I'm a 12-year-old NFT Artist

I started drawing when I was 4. When I was 9, my parents got me a smartphone. I used it to make digital art. I made drawings of people with long necks. I call these Long Neckies. This past March, my uncle told my mom about NFTs. We watched YouTube to learn how to make and sell them. Soon, people were buying NFTs of my Long Neckies. I have made more than 960 ETH. (That’s digital currency worth more than $3 million.) The NFT community is amazing! —Nyla Hayes, as told to TFK

On October 6, the World Health Organization (WHO) made an announcement. It endorsed a vaccine that helps protect against malaria. The WHO says the vaccine, Mosquirix, should be given to children in parts of Africa. Malaria is carried by mosquitoes. It kills more than 400,000 people every year. Most of them live in Africa. 
“Today’s recommendation offers a glimmer of hope for the continent,” says Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, the WHO’s Africa director. “We expect many more African children to be protected from malaria and grow into healthy adults.”
The vaccine has its drawbacks. It’s only about 30% effective against the worst cases. And a person must get up to four doses. Protection fades after only a few months. But health officials say it could be a breakthrough in the fight against malaria. 
The WHO based its advice on research. This research tracked more than 800,000 children. They had all gotten the vaccine since 2019.

Bill Greason is proud to be a veteran of the United States military. He is 97 years old. He fought in World War II. Today, Greason lives in Birmingham, Alabama. “I loved being a Marine,” he told TIME for Kids.
Greason calls it a “tremendous blessing” to have been in the military. He feels grateful to have survived his service. Many people who fought alongside him did not.

A monument stands at Arlington National Cemetery, in Virginia. It’s called the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. It honors those who died during service and who could not be identified or brought home. This year is the tomb’s 100-year anniversary. It’s on Veterans Day, November 11.
A World War I veteran named Hamilton Fish suggested the idea for the tomb in 1920. His idea was approved. An unknown serviceman killed in World War I was selected to be buried there. A funeral for the soldier was held at Arlington on November 11, 1921.

In 1958, soldiers from World War II and the Korean War were buried at the tomb. This symbolizes “that no veteran is forgotten,” John Raughter says. He’s with the American Legion. It is a group for veterans. 
Veterans Day
Veterans Day is not only for honoring those who have died. It’s also for celebrating living veterans.“That’s the key distinction” between the holidays, Raughter says. “Veterans Day honors anyone who has ever served in the U.S. military. Memorial Day honors the fallen.""

Many cities hold Veterans Day parades. Bridgette Guinn, 8, lives in Killeen, Texas. Her dad is a veteran of the U.S. Army. In 2019, Bridgette marched in a Veterans Day parade with her Girl Scout troop. “There were a ton of people,” she says.
Kids can also celebrate Veterans Day by sending cards and care packages to veterans hospitals. “Those items are always appreciated,” Raughter says. “The best way to honor a living veteran is to thank them for their service.”

The family member who’s in the military can get hurt or even killed. We were born in Colorado, then moved to California, then Virginia. Some military families move even more than that.

Devorah Heitner is an expert on how young people use digital media. TFK Kid Reporter Orlie Weitzman spoke with her.
1. Instagram delayed releasing an app for kids under 13. What does this mean?
Instagram did research and found that its app had negative effects on teenage girls. The  sends girls to content that affects their body image and makes them feel bad about themselves. 
2. Does all social media work like Instagram? 
I don’t think social media is always bad. But it can be if it makes kids feel left out or distracts them from doing other things they might enjoy.
3. Should there be more laws protecting kids on social media? 
There should be more  of the ways social media can work. It’s also important that parents help kids make decisions about what apps to use and how to use them.
4. What is digital citizenship?
It’s the idea that we’re all participating in a digital community and that we should strive to be our best selves. When we interact on a digital platform, we should take the same thoughtful approach we’d take to an in-person interaction.
5. Thoughtfulness does not always happen, does it? 
Life outside of school used to be a haven for kids who were having negative interactions in school. Now kids can have negative interactions even when they’re not at school. Adults might say, “Turn it off.” But if kids feel their life is on social media, they’ll want to spend time there. 
6. What should I do if I’m bullied—or see someone bullied—online or on social media?
That’s not a problem you can solve on your own. If you’re experiencing in-person or digital bullying or harassment, tell a parent or an adult at school.
7. Should my parents know about my digital life?  
Absolutely. Adults can relate to questions like, “What do I do if someone follows me and I don’t want to follow them back?” Adults can learn from kids on these issues, too.8. So what’s the positive side of digital media? Kids can be creative or connect with friends, especially during a pandemic. It’s also a place where kids can be activists.

148,148,A Win for Mental Health,"{'Sports', 'Health'}","
Simone Biles was expected to lead the United States women’s gymnastics team to an Olympic gold medal in Tokyo, Japan. But not long into the competition on July 27, Biles  from the team event.  
Biles told reporters that stress had taken its toll. She was not injured, she said. But “once I came out here, I was like, ‘No, [the] mental [element] is not there. So I just need to let [my teammates] do it and focus on myself.’”

 
Biles isn’t the first athlete to speak out about the pressure of competitive sports. In May, tennis star Naomi Osaka withdrew from the French Open. She was concerned about her mental health. Swimmer Michael Phelps has long spoken about his struggles. “We’re human beings,” he says. “It is okay not to be okay.” 
Athletes are usually taught to focus on winning. They work through pain and injury. But now, sports stars are pushing back against that thinking. They say winning should not take priority over their health.  “It’s okay sometimes to even sit out the big competitions to focus on yourself,” Biles said. “It shows how strong of a competitor and person that you really are.”
Are You Okay?
Jill Emanuele is a director at the Child Mind Institute. The organization is in New York City. It specializes in children’s mental health. Emanuele says star athletes are setting a positive example. “The message now is that being tough means paying attention to yourself and making sure you’re okay,” she says.
In sports, mind and body must work together. “You can have an incredible athlete, but if they’re not in the right [head]space to perform, they’ll ,” Emanuele says.  
 That could lead to injuries. It’s why Biles did not continue in the team event. Her mid-air twists are dangerous to perform. They require complete focus.  

Emanuele advises young athletes to “[talk] to people when you have trouble.” That’s what Biles did. And with the support of her team, she was able to return to competition. She finished the Olympic Games with a bronze medal in the women’s balance-beam final.

I think it’s so cool that Simone Biles is speaking out about her mental health. I sometimes struggle with anxiety. So it’s helpful to know that even famous people and superstrong athletes wrestle with nerves.

But then Biles decided not to compete in the Olympics team event because of the “twisties.” She reminded the world that she’s human too. 
It’s not all sunshine and rainbows for a famous athlete. It’s hard to be a role model. So I thank Biles for being brave enough to speak out about her mental health. I had some questions for her. Biles was kind enough to answer over email. 

 GABRI: What was it like to step out of Olympic competition because of your mental health?
 BILES: It was one of the toughest decisions I’ve ever had to make, on a global scene. But I knew that ultimately, it was the best decision for myself, as well as for the team.

 GABRI: Was it hard watching your teammates compete without you?
BILES: It wasn’t hard watching them compete without me. They were fully prepared and ready. I’m so proud of them for how they handled the situation on a moment’s notice, and under so much pressure.

 GABRI: What advice would you give kids like me, who struggle with anxiety?
 BILES: Stay true to yourself. Listen to yourself. But don’t be afraid to ask for help, either. It’s not a sign of weakness to ask for help. It’s a sign of strength.

“Turn worry into strength.” It’s normal to feel worried. The key is to turn it into strength, Jain says. Maybe you have a big test coming up. Or you want to perform well at a recital. Worry can actually help you focus. Have you ever gotten butterflies in your stomach? “That’s your worry helping you rise to the challenge,” Jain says. “It can motivate you.""
“Bring back the dominos.” Anxiety has a domino effect: We think of the worst-case scenario for how things could turn out, and this makes us even more anxious. Try to practice accurate thinking instead. “Anxiety causes us to imagine things that will likely not happen,” Jain says. “Bring the dominoes back and come to a place of accuracy.”

A new series called Among the Stars follows astronaut Chris Cassidy on his last mission to the International Space Station (ISS). TFK Kid Reporter Creedence Peterson spoke with him.
1. What’s the scariest moment you’ve had on a space mission?
It has to be a spacewalk with Luca Parmitano. Water started coming into his helmet.
2. Civilians have now gone to space on privately funded missions. How common do you think it’ll be for kids in my generation to go to space?
I think it’s going to become much more common for nonprofessional astronauts to go to space. Certainly, in your lifetime, a family could decide to take a space vacation.
3. Have you ever been scared you’ll float away while walking in space?
Becoming untethered is something that we train hard to not do. If you do, there’s a mini jet pack. We train on how to use that to get back to the space station. It’s still scary when you go outside the spacecraft your first time, or even your 10th time, like I have.
4. You were responsible for fixing the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS). What is it?
The AMS is a device that studies the origins of the universe. It’s a piece of equipment that gives scientists around the globe so much data to learn from.
5. Did COVID-19 have an impact on your mission?
In terms of our day-to-day life on board the space station, nothing really changed for us. It was largely life as normal.
6. Have you ever gotten spacesick?
Space sickness can happen to anyone. It happens soon after the rocket engines cut off. You go from Earth gravity to g-force through the acceleration of launch, and then boom: You’re floating. Many of us take motion-sickness medication on the launchpad. But it happens to all of us eventually.
7. Is it hard to sleep in space?
It’s a little hard when you’re not used to it. You have no pillow up there. You’re just floating.
8. Does food taste different in space?
No. Tastes the same.

Meet Via Ryerson, one of the 10 outstanding kids selected to be a TFK Kid Reporter this school year. Via is 9 years old and lives in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. She aspires to be a U.S. Supreme Court justice. Via says that her proudest accomplishment is winning a state tournament with her chess team. 
Finalists in the TFK Kid Reporter contest were judged on a number of factors. One of their assignments was to write an article about a hometown hero. Via’s story is about Dr. Eugenia South, of the University of Pennsylvania. You can read it below.

Dr. Eugenia South, director of the Urban Health Lab and assistant professor of emergency medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, is researching and working to help Black people get vaccinated against COVID-19.

Dr. South is a Black doctor who was hesitant about getting the vaccine. She researched vaccine safety and received her vaccine. Afterward she talked to other Black doctors and friends. “I realized a lot of people had the same concerns as I had, but they did not have the opportunity to talk to anyone about their concerns,” Dr. South told TIME for Kids. According to the Association of American Medical Colleges, only 5% of doctors are Black. This means many Black people do not have Black doctors to talk to. 
Research by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that Black people are more likely to die or suffer from severe illness because of COVID-19 than white people. Dr. South knew it was critical for Black people to get the vaccine. But, says Dr. Shreya Kangovi, founding executive director of the Penn Center for Community Health Workers, many Black people are hesitant to get the COVID-19 vaccine because “there have been many times, even in the present day, where they may not be able to trust the information that they are getting from their doctors or nurses or even public institutions. . . . Black people aren’t just dying of COVID, they’re dying of unfairness.” 
In January, Dr. South wrote an article for NBC News about her hesitancy with the vaccine. She says her favorite part of writing the article was “having the opportunity to share my story and to share it on such a platform. I’ve heard from a lot of people across the country that my words had an influence on them and they made a decision to get the vaccine because of what I wrote.”
Dr. South helped start a clinic in West Philadelphia, a part of the city where three-quarters of people are Black. More than 500 Black people were vaccinated at the clinic in one day. Dr. South also did a Zoom call with 21 pastors of Black churches, telling them about her experience with the vaccine. Pastor W. Lonnie Herndon, of the Church of Christian Compassion, says, “Her transparency, her care, her compassion, her concern, and seeing a physician that looks like the members of the community opened the door for us to talk about the vaccine. She helped thousands get on board with getting the vaccine.”
Dr. South is a hometown hero. She works to get Black people the COVID-19 vaccine while “doing innovative research to reduce health inequities,” says Dr. Kangovi. 
Dr. South inspires people to help their communities. She means it when she says, “If you see something that you want to change, make it happen.”

158,158,TFK Kid Reporters: Meet Tabitha,"{'People', 'Community'}","
Meet Tabitha Kho, one of the 10 outstanding kids selected to be a TFK Kid Reporter this school year. Tabitha is 11 years old and lives in Atlanta, Georgia. She enjoys skiing, hates mosquitoes, and loves to read. Some of Tabitha’s favorite books are The Westing Game, The Phantom Tollbooth, and Chris Colfer’s Land of Stories series.
Finalists in the TFK Kid Reporter contest were judged on a number of factors. One of their assignments was to write an article about a hometown hero. Tabitha’s story is about the founders of an organization that supports food-service workers. You can read it below. 

COVID-19 robbed millions of food-service workers of their jobs as some restaurants went bankrupt and others ran dry of customers. People were abruptly thrown into crisis. 
Janae’ Littlejohn was one of those people. She worked as a recruiter by day and in the food-service industry by night to support her dream of becoming Miss America. Then she lost her car in an accident on her way to a pageant competition. Shortly after that, Littlejohn began to feel sick. Struggling to breathe and unable to work because of COVID-19, she faced homelessness. But then, Littlejohn told TIME for Kids, “Giving Kitchen brought hope back into my world.”
Giving Kitchen is an organization that was “designed to provide stability to food-service workers in crisis,” Naomi Green says. She’s Giving Kitchen’s senior director of field operations. 
Giving Kitchen was born out of crisis in 2012. On December 21 of that year, Ryan Hidinger was diagnosed with cancer and given six months to live. He and his wife, Jen, had moved to Atlanta, Georgia, with a dream of starting a restaurant. They had hosted a supper club for a few years as a way of bonding with their new community. After Ryan’s diagnosis, that community made all the difference. A fundraiser set up to support the Hidingers was meant to raise $25,000 but accumulated nearly $300,000! At the time, Ryan said he felt he “had already won in life.”
Then, Jen says, the couple heard “so many more stories” of other food-service workers who had gotten hurt or sick and were unable to work. The stories “became incredibly real,” she says. “We immediately shared that money with other people in need.” 

Ryan and Jen founded Giving Kitchen to give back to their community. Today, Jen continues the work that she and her late husband began, enlarging Giving Kitchen to serve more people in more ways. Since dedicating herself to the effort full-time, in 2019, Jen has helped Giving Kitchen expand beyond Georgia. She helped set up a program in Nashville, Tennessee, with the goal of helping people throughout the nation.
The organization has grown in other ways, too. “Those first years, [people] would tell us that they were really suffering from depression” or other problems, Jen says. So Giving Kitchen connected people with helpful resources. “We started to develop close relationships with service providers who were willing to offer their services for low or no cost to our clients,” she says.
Now, long after receiving life-changing help, Littlejohn works with Giving Kitchen too. “I find . . . redemption in it,” she says. Littlejohn may not have been able to attain her Miss America crown. But “I’m still gonna wear a crown, even if I didn’t win one that day,” she says. 
On June 8, Jen gave Littlejohn a Giving Kitchen crown of her own.

159,159,Reef Relief?,"{'Environment', 'Places'}","
Tony Fontes is from California. He first went scuba diving at Australia’s Great Barrier Reef in 1979. Fontes was amazed by the experience.  He decided to stay in Australia and work as a dive instructor. “The marine life and the quality of coral [were] unmatched,” he told TIME. 

Over the years, Fontes has seen the reef’s health decline. So he was disappointed on July 23.  On that day, the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) made an announcement. It had decided to delay labeling the reef as “in danger.” This label would have given the reef “the kind of protection it needs,” Fontes says. Could the delay cost the Great Barrier Reef its future?
Behind the Decision
The Great Barrier Reef is the world’s largest coral reef . It stretches for 1,430 miles along the northeast coast of Australia. It can be seen from space. The reef is a UNESCO World Heritage site (see “Around the World”). 
On June 21, UNESCO recommended that the reef be placed on a list of “in danger” World Heritage sites. UNESCO said  is a “serious threat” to the reef. But Australia’s government argued against the “in danger” label. The reef is one of the country’s top tourist spots. It attracts millions of visitors a year. That may change if the reef is listed as endangered.

The day after UNESCO’s announcement, Sussan Ley made a statement. Ley is a member of Australia’s government. She’s in charge of environmental issues. “This . . . recommendation has been made without examining the reef firsthand and without the latest information,” she said. Ley noted that the country was spending  $3 billion Australian (about $2 billion United States) to protect the reef. 
In response, UNESCO announced on July 23 that it would wait to make its decision. It asked Australia’s government to deliver a report on the reef. That report is expected by February 2022.
Climate Change Concerns
Environmentalists and scientists are worried about UNESCO’s delayed decision. Many have warned of the danger that climate change poses to the reef. 
In 2020, researchers from the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies, in Queensland, Australia, released a study. It found that from 1995 to 2017, the Great Barrier Reef had lost more than half of its corals. And there were three mass bleaching events from 2016 to 2020. (Bleaching happens when corals are stressed by changes in conditions. These include warming waters.)

With its report due early next year, Australia has to prove it’s willing to take action. Fontes hopes for the best. It’s “the most incredible reef,” he says. “But it’s in serious trouble.”
 Around the World
The Great Barrier Reef is a World Heritage site. It is one of 1,154. UNESCO says a place must be “of outstanding universal value” to make the list. It must meet at least one of 10 criteria. These are natural, cultural, and historical reasons a site might be important. The Porticoes of Bologna (below) are in Italy. They were one of the sites UNESCO added in 2021. Being on the list attracts tourism. It also draws attention to places that are environmentally important.

California’s KNP Complex wildfire forced the evacuation of Sequoia National Park on September 14. The blaze threatened the park’s giant sequoia trees. These are some of the largest trees in the world. 
By September 17, the fire had reached the edge of the park’s Giant Forest. That’s a grove of 2,000 sequoias. Firefighters covered the bases of trees with heat-resistant aluminum. This helped keep the fire from reaching farther into the area. “The fire perimeter kind of wraps around the Giant Forest,” fire spokesperson Rebecca Paterson says. 
A blaze called the Windy Fire burned through other sequoia groves. These included Peyrone and Red Hill. It also struck the Trail of 100 Giants, at the Giant Sequoia National Monument. At press time, the fire had burned almost 50 square miles. It was only 7% contained. 
Scientists say climate change is causing warmer and drier conditions in the West. These conditions will lead to more-frequent wildfires.

The spotted lanternfly might look pretty with its red wings and black dots. But the mothlike insect is causing big problems in the United States. Experts are telling people to take action against the pest.
“Kill it! Squash it, smash it . . . just get rid of it.” That’s what the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture says to do if you see one. The spotted lanternfly is native to Asia. In the U.S., it’s an invasive species. The bugs were found in Pennsylvania in 2014. They have now spread to at least nine states. 
Spotted lanternflies are not dangerous to humans. But they can cause serious harm to plants. They suck sap from trees and release a sticky substance after they feed. This causes mold to grow on plants.

The story “Testing the Water”—about how scientists are testing wastewater for the coronavirus—appears in this week’s issue of TIME for Kids. Allie Amison took part in a wastewater testing program at her school, and writes about it below.

The University of California San Diego (UCSD), runs a program called Safer at School Early Alert, or SASEA. It’s for schools and childcare facilities. I go to Vista Grande Elementary, in El Cajon, California. I was lucky enough to participate in SASEA. The program uses a robot to test wastewater for the virus that causes COVID-19. We named our robot Harry Botter. It has tubes that go into sewer drains to bring up wastewater for laboratory testing. It was really cool to see the robot in action. The SASEA program also does voluntary nasal swab testing. 
I got tested for COVID-19 once a week for about eight weeks. I hope programs like SASEA will help kids around the world get back to school safely. I’m so thankful that SASEA was there to help our school.

If it’s flushed down the toilet, Rob Knight wants to know about it. He’s a researcher at the University of California San Diego. He specializes in microbes. These are tiny organisms that live in your gut.  
Knight is testing the university’s . He’s looking for the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. The virus can be found in pee and poop even before people show symptoms of the disease.

Knight uses a robot. It collects samples of wastewater from a building’s pipes. If tests find the virus in those samples, people are warned to stay away. Knight’s team then gives COVID-19 tests to everyone who uses the building. Anyone infected is kept out.
The system has reduced cases of the disease at the university. Samples testing positive dropped from around 80% in January to just 5% in the spring. It has “exceeded our wildest dreams,” Knight told TIME. 

Speedy Results
Knight’s system could work for cities and states. Officials could test the wastewater in sewage plants. This would tell them if the virus was there before many people showed symptoms. 
By testing people in that area, they could identify infected people and tell them to stay home. This might stop an outbreak before it happened.
In September 2020, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) started a national wastewater  program. Currently, 33 states and four cities can upload wastewater information to the CDC’s online database. Scientists study the data. Officials could get the results six days sooner than they would just by testing people for COVID-19.

“It’s enough time to really make a difference,” Amy Kirby says. She leads the CDC program.
This could be a way to fight diseases in the future, Kirby says. The next dangerous virus could be picked up and managed more quickly—thanks to our pee and poop.

169,169,TFK Kid Reporters: Meet Lucy,"{'People', 'Community'}","
Meet Lucy Sandor, one of the 10 outstanding kids selected to be a TFK Kid Reporter this school year. Lucy is 11 years old and lives in Caldwell, New Jersey. She loves to skateboard and play her ukulele. As a reporter, Lucy hopes to cover a Comic-Con event or interview writer Neil Gaiman.
Finalists in the TFK Kid Reporter contest were judged on a number of factors. One of their assignments was to write an article about a hometown hero. Lucy’s story is about two teenagers who brought hope to nursing-home residents during the COVID-19 pandemic. You can read it below. We’ll be introducing the rest of the TFK Kid Reporter squad throughout September.

When most people think of heroes, they don’t picture teenage girls. But if you ask the residents at Family of Caring nursing home in Montclair, New Jersey, to name someone heroic, they will tell you that two local high schoolers rescued them from isolation and restored their sense of hope. 
Annika Aristimuno and Layla Hurwitz started writing letters and sending artwork to residents at Family of Caring in March 2020, when COVID-19 kept the girls from going into the home for their community-service club. Annika and Layla reached out to friends and family to ask if they also wanted to send letters. In a month, the girls had dozens of volunteers and more than 50 pieces of mail to send. 
Annika and Layla realized they needed to get organized. They called their project Letters for Rose. The name came from one of their favorite residents, Rose, who had always been excited to see the girls when they were still allowed to make in-person visits. “Rose would grab our hands and be really happy to see us,” Annika told TIME for Kids. “She was looking for that person from outside [the home] to interact with.” 
The idea to write letters to residents came from Layla’s memory of seeing a resident get a letter from a family member. “She started crying, and it was this big moment for her,” Layla says.
To spread the word about Letters for Rose, Annika and Layla set up Instagram and TikTok accounts, as well as a website. People all over the country were inspired and asked how they could begin their own chapters, so the girls developed “a really easy program for how to get started,” Annika says. Just 16 months after Letters for Rose was born, there were more than 280 chapters throughout 35 states and more than 6,000 volunteers. 
The starter program includes advice for making letters more personal and meaningful. These elements make all the difference, according to Nancy Sherman. She is an activities coordinator at Friendship Village, a senior-living community in Tempe, Arizona. “The letters were personalized, [and the residents] read them over and over,” Sherman says. “It was so nice at a time when we couldn’t have any visitors.” 
It's not just the nursing-home residents who see Annika and Layla as heroes. The Letters for Rose volunteers do, too. Teens also faced isolation during COVID-19. This project helped restore “warm feelings” of connection, says Krista Lee, a letter writer for the Brookline, Massachusetts, chapter. 
Letters for Rose Montclair outreach coordinator Julianne Eckert agrees. Annika and Layla’s project “helped me gain confidence,” she says. “Even when [residents] don’t respond, I feel like I’ve made a connection, which is such an important part of life and being a happy, healthy person.”

Meet Ethan Zhang, one of the 10 outstanding kids selected to be a TFK Kid Reporter this school year. Ethan is 9 years old and lives in McLean, Virginia. He loves realistic fiction books, hates movie spoilers, and hopes to be a writer or an athlete when he grows up.
Finalists in the TFK Kid Reporter contest were judged on a number of factors. One of their assignments was to write an article about a hometown hero. Ethan’s story is about Maria Perrone, the leader of a program that serves healthy meals to kids in Fairfax County, Virginia. You can read it below.

It’s 9:50 a.m. on July 22, 2021. Outside Shrevewood Elementary School, in Falls Church, Virginia, a school bus pulls over. A boy heads to its rear door, where he is handed two heavy, chilled bags. Inside is a week's worth of milk, fresh apples and oranges, muffins, burgers, and pizzas. 
This is not your regular school bus—after all, it’s summer break. But every day, 10 buses like this one travel to families in the Fairfax County Public Schools (FCPS) system to drop off food. These vehicles are nicknamed Meal Kit Buses. They are part of the FCPS free grab-and-go meal program. The person leading the program is Maria Perrone. Her mission: serving healthy meals.
Giving good food to kids in one of the nation’s largest school systems is a big task. “About 60,000 [students in the county] are eligible for free and reduced-price meals,” Perrone told TIME for Kids. Addressing food insecurity has been Perrone’s priority during her 15 years in food services. It has become even more important during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Perrone and her team, who have been “the boots on the ground” as she puts it, are working nonstop. Meal distribution by bus started on the first day that the county’s schools closed because of COVID-19: March 13, 2020. To cover the county’s 400 square miles, 418 bus stops and 120 meal distribution sites were set up. 
Perrone begins her workday at 5 a.m. She spends a lot of her time responding to unknowns—such as unanticipated food and staff shortages, two particular challenges this past year. “I try to be prepared for anything that could potentially not go as planned,” she says.
The result: More than 14.5 million meals have been distributed since March 2020. “Meals have been the one constant this last year,” Perrone says. This accountability is crucial during uncertain times. The meal buses serve as a lifeline for many. 
For some, getting food from the Meal Kit Buses has become an event to look forward to. “I love coming here,” says the boy from earlier. “It’s like a playdate.” He smiles. 
“The kids feel like they are visiting the school cafeteria even though schools are closed,” his mom adds.
Perrone’s peers recognize her efforts. Coworker Megan Mauer says that Perrone “always puts FCPS students and employees first.” And Perrone was honored by FCPS as a 2021 Outstanding Employee. The awards’ web page notes that she “strives to ensure all children receive the nourishment needed to achieve academic success.”

171,171,Saving Monarchs,"{'Environment', 'Animals'}","
In the 1980s, about 4½ million monarch butterflies spent winter on the coast of California and northern Mexico every year. “There would be these forests of monarch butterflies looking like leaves on trees,” Elizabeth Crone told TIME for Kids. She’s a professor at Tufts University. That’s in Massachusetts. Crone studies monarchs.

 
In 2020, fewer than 2,000 monarchs were counted in California. Their population has dropped more than 99%. “The decline has been pretty staggering,” Hillary Sardiñas says. She works for the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW). In the West, “folks haven’t seen monarchs in a number of years.”
CDFW, River Partners, and other groups want to change that. They began last year to plant 30,000 milkweeds in California. Monarchs need milkweed to survive. Will this plan save the species?
Monarchs and Milkweed
Monarchs breed only where milkweed is growing. Females lay eggs on it. Monarch caterpillars eat it. The plant is poisonous to many animals. But not to monarchs. Its poisons build up in the butterfly’s body. This makes the monarch deadly to predators.

In California, milkweed is “virtually gone” due to farming, according to Cheryl Schultz. She teaches at Washington State University. She’s an adviser on the project. Schultz says the goal “is to get enough milkweed into the landscape so that when monarchs are migrating and leave the coast, they can find places to breed.” 

 
There are two groups of monarch butterflies in North America. Eastern monarchs live east of the Rocky Mountains. They migrate south to Mexico in the fall. They fly back north in the spring. Western monarchs live west of the Rockies. In the fall, they migrate to California and northern Mexico. In the spring, they fly .
Both groups are in decline. Scientists blame habitat loss, climate change, and pesticides. But monarchs aren’t on the endangered-species list. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service said last year that the butterflies deserved protection. But it thinks other species need more help.
In the Field
Last March, Asia Jones led a planting crew for River Partners. It worked at the Yolo Bypass Wildlife Area. Team members planted milkweed . “They’d walk in a straight line down a row,” Jones says. “Every three feet, they’d dig a quick hole and throw in a rhizome.” 

 

Data from the next western monarch butterfly count is due in January. “People like to see these bright-colored orange butterflies,” Crone says. Schultz thinks it will take at least 10 years for the numbers to go up. “Restoring the habitat takes time,” she says. “But I have an incredible sense of hope that we can do this.”
You Can Help

Do your part to protect monarchs. “What I want kids to do is get engaged,” says Hillary Sardiñas of the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. How? Plant native milkweed. And if you are in the West and you see a monarch, take a photo. Upload it to the Western Monarch Milkweed Mapper. “You can help track the migrating monarchs and understand where they are during the year,” Sardiñas says. “That is super valuable information to us.”

Last year, a 9-year-old boy from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, set up a lemonade stand. He got lots of customers. “They all took a sip of lemonade and either gave a thumbs-up or said it was really good!” he told TIME for Kids. Even so, he didn’t want to share his name for this article. That’s because he found out he’d broken a state law by operating a business without a permit.
In most states, it’s illegal for kids to open a lemonade stand without first applying for a permit or license. These laws have a purpose. They stop business owners from disregarding food-safety standards and traffic rules. But permits and licenses cost time and money. 
The good news for young ? In recent years, several states have made it easier for kids to run lemonade stands. And more lawmakers are getting on board.
Passing a Bill
Pennsylvania now supports kids selling lemonade. John Hershey is a state representative there. In February, he introduced a bill. It was nicknamed Free the Lemonade Stand. It  kids from having to get a permit or license before starting most small, short-term businesses. Hershey says running a lemonade stand is an “opportunity that young kids should have.” 
Tom Wolf is Pennsylvania’s governor. On June 30, he signed Hershey’s bill into law. 
Reaping Rewards
There are many reasons for a kid to start a business. They include raising money for charity and keeping busy. Victoria Hanson, 11, is a former TFK Kid Reporter. She lives in Chadds Ford Township, Pennsylvania. Victoria supports her state’s new law. “Children are not old enough to apply for jobs,” she says. “Selling lemonade is an easy way for kids to make money.” 
Hershey says that kids who run a business learn valuable skills. “The American dream is to want to build something for yourself,” he says. And this new lemonade-stand law “helps kids do that at an early age.”

Running a business can be both complicated and rewarding. Should kids be allowed to take on that task? Some say running a business lets kids earn money and learn how to manage it. It’s never too early to pick up such skills. Others say that in the long run, kids benefit more from focusing on school and extracurricular activities. Running a business can be distracting.
Should kids run businesses? TFK Kid Reporters Ethan Zhang and Via Ryerson weigh in. What do you think?  
Yes
Ethan Zhang, 9
McClean, Virginia
Did you know that Warren Buffett, one of the world’s greatest businessmen, sold chewing gum and soda to his neighbors when he was a kid? Running a business at a young age can teach you skills that will benefit you in the future. According to Gallup survey published in 2017, 40% of kids in grades 5 through 12 plan to one day start a business. Giving it a try early on can help you learn. It can also get you ready for new opportunities. 
Becoming a young entrepreneur teaches you important lessons. These include how to set goals and how to manage money. Finally, running a business teaches critical thinking and persistence. These skills can help you excel in school. 
No
Via Ryerson, 9
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
Kids should not run businesses. They should be expanding their knowledge by focusing on school. They learn an array of subjects at school—more than they’ll learn from a business. The more subjects kids learn, the wider the range of things they can do when they get older. 
When kids aren’t running a business, they are more likely to join after-school clubs or sports teams. These activities can build mental and physical strength. They can also teach kids to solve problems and collaborate. 
Plus, kids who are running a business have less time to spend having fun. Kids should just be kids.

Ynairaly Simo, 14, voices Gabi. Ynairaly has been acting since she was 5. She also loves music. Vivo features a song called “My Own Drum,” which Ynairaly got to perform solo. “It was so much fun! It was my first time at a recording studio recording a song,” she told TIME for Kids. 
Playing Gabi wasn’t hard, Ynairaly says, because she and the character are so similar. 
“I admire that she doesn’t care what anyone thinks about her and that she does whatever makes her feel happy,” Ynairaly says.

In Nic Stone’s Fast Pitch, Shenice Lockwood is captain of the Fulton Firebirds. It’s the first all-Black team in Georgia’s Dixie Youth Softball Association. Shenice is determined to take her team to the championship. But she loses focus after learning a family secret. Shenice’s great-grandfather JonJon was once accused of theft and kicked out of his baseball league. Her great-uncle says JonJon was framed. Can Shenice unravel her family history and still lead her team to victory? 
Like Shenice, Stone played softball as a kid. She told TFK she wrote Fast Pitch because she “never saw books about Black girls playing sports” when she was growing up. She wanted that to be different for kids today.

182,182,TFK Kid Reporters: Meet Lauryn,"{'People', 'Community'}","
Meet Lauryn Chew, one of the 10 outstanding kids selected to be a TFK Kid Reporter this school year. Lauryn is 13 years old and lives in Irvine, California. She loves to Rollerblade with her friends and do ballet. Lauryn says she would like to work as a public-health official one day.
Finalists in the TFK Kid Reporter contest were judged on a number of factors. One of their assignments was to write an article about a hometown hero. Lauryn’s story is about Elaine Murphy, a Girl Scout troop leader in Orange County, California. You can read it below. We’ll be introducing the rest of the TFK Kid Reporter squad this month.

“Make the world a better place.” This Girl Scout law guides more than 1.7 million Girl Scouts around the world. In just 12 years, Orange County Girl Scout troop leader Elaine Murphy has helped more than 150 girls build courage and self-confidence. But her troop has a unique story. It’s based at the Orange County Rescue Mission, which helps bring families out of homelessness.
Murphy has been an active member of Girl Scouts for three decades. An old friend and fellow scout reached out to her about starting a troop at the Orange County Rescue Mission. In 2009, the two started Troop 1082 with just five girls. “I wanted to give the girls the same opportunities that I had and that other girls have,” Elaine told TIME for Kids. “I hoped they’d realize that anything was possible and could see their full potential through Girl Scouts. And many of them have done that.” The girls have achieved high-level awards like the Girl Scout Gold Award, gone camping, and traveled internationally to Our Cabaña, the Girl Scout World Center in Mexico.
The troop’s primary challenge has been limited technology access. Communications, activities, and projects typically happen in person, but the pandemic has stopped the year-round weekly meetings. To overcome this obstacle, Murphy has met with scouts one-on-one so the girls could continue their projects. She does this because of her dedication and passion. “She has a lot of empathy for anyone who has been pushed aside in the community,” says her mom, Karen.
Murphy shows no signs of leaving her leadership role. “Seeing their accomplishments and their achievements and how much they love Girl Scouts is by far the best part for me,” she says. Murphy is proud of her girls and thankful for her hardworking coleaders.
Being in Troop 1082 has significantly impacted the scouts. Valerie, 10, is one of them. Before joining, she felt excluded, because many girls she knew were scouts. “[Murphy] helped me have a fun time and come out of my shell,” Valerie says. “She makes the Girl Scout meetings really fun and lets us do so many awesome activities.”
As a leader of Troop 1082, Elaine has faced numerous challenges and has an important message to share: No matter who you are, where you come from, or what you believe, you can help create a better future for the leaders of tomorrow.

183,183,TFK Kid Reporters: Meet David,"{'People', 'Community'}","
Meet David Murtagh, one of the 10 outstanding kids selected to be a TFK Kid Reporter this school year. David is 11 years old and lives in Alexandria, Virginia. He likes to play the piano and ride his bike. David also likes to use his “old-style record player” to listen to music. 
Finalists in the TFK Kid Reporter contest were judged on a number of factors. One of their assignments was to write an article about a hometown hero. David’s story is about Alton Wallace, who started a foundation to help children go to college. You can read about it below. We’ll be introducing the rest of the TFK Kid Reporter squad throughout September.


Alton Wallace, 77, is the son of a Black farmer. Wallace grew up in New Bern, North Carolina. He spent his youth outside, enjoying nature. Wallace attended the local overcrowded and segregated schools, which lacked supplies and equipment. He was picked as one of only a few students from his school who were permitted to take the SAT at an all-white public school. He was awarded a scholarship to North Carolina Agricultural and Technical (A&T) State University, in Greensboro. 
In 1960, students from North Carolina A&T sat down at a lunch counter and refused to leave until they were served, starting a historic sit-in movement among Black students across the country. Three years later, Wallace participated in the second wave of sit-ins. He says he was arrested at a movie theater and spent a week in jail. Wallace says that once he got out, he attended another sit-in and was held for a week at the Greensboro Coliseum because the jail was full. 
Wallace says that, in 1966, he was driving home on Good Friday when he heard on the radio that the church he had attended as a child had been the target of an attack by the Ku Klux Klan. That was one of several events that shaped his passion to get involved in civil rights work. Another happened when Wallace was a teenager. He was standing on the side of the road and some white boys drove by and threw rocks at him. He recognized one of the boys as his former best friend. They had spent summers together when they were children. “It broke my heart,” Wallace told TIME for Kids.
Wallace graduated from Pennsylvania State University in 1968. He then served in the Army. He spent part of his military career in Vietnam. Afterward, in 1974, Wallace received a PhD in mathematics from the University of Maryland. It was while getting his PhD that Wallace decided he wanted to help poor children, through education. 
Wallace went on to become a founder of the Alfred Street Baptist Church Foundation. It raises money for scholarships that go to high-school students who cannot otherwise afford college. Hundreds of students have received these scholarships.

184,184,Inside the Crew Dragon,"{'Technology', 'Space'}","
How do you fly a SpaceX Crew Dragon? Climb aboard, strap yourself in, close the hatch, and fly into space. The Dragon takes care of everything, so relax and enjoy the ride. Unless something goes wrong. And in space, something always can. 
How do you prepare for that? Spend months training. Master hundreds of pages of . Learn the many systems aboard the spacecraft. And train for emergencies. 
“In a multiday mission, there is a lot of time for a lot of things to go wrong,” Jared Isaacman says. He’s the CEO of the online payment service Shift4 Payments. Isaacman will be commanding the Inspiration4 mission. It is scheduled to launch on September 15. He and three other civilian, or nonprofessional, astronauts will spend three days in orbit. 

Inspiration4 is the world’s first all-civilian mission to orbit Earth. Isaacman will be joined by three others. They are Chris Sembroski, Sian Proctor, and Hayley Arceneaux. (See “Meet the Crew.”) Isaacman hopes the Inspiration4 mission will raise money and awareness for St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital. The hospital researches and treats childhood cancers and other life-threatening diseases.
A New Kind of Training
The astronauts have practiced for all the possibilities of what can happen in space. This takes a new kind of training. Older space capsules were designed differently. Their instrument panels had hundreds of buttons. Their simple onboard computers were controlled by a keyboard. The commander flew those ships similarly to how you’d fly a plane. He or she used a control stick. The Dragon’s designers replaced almost everything with three large touch screens. Even the control stick. Each screen can call up 10 sets of displays.

Ideally, the spacecraft helps the astronauts so much that they have almost nothing to do. It runs on its own. “And if the  doesn’t take care of a problem, then the ground is your next layer of defense,” Doug Hurley says. He was commander of the first crewed SpaceX mission. He’s talking about the SpaceX ground controllers. They solve problems. And they issue commands to the spacecraft from mission control on Earth. Only if the Dragon fails to look after itself would the astronauts take over.
That’s also the case when it comes to flying the craft. The Dragon has a program that requires no help from the astronauts. On Hurley’s flight, he took over near the International Space Station (ISS). But only to make sure the  systems worked. 

Learning to fly the Dragon by hand can take some doing. Removing the control stick and replacing it with a touch screen might make for a more elegant spacecraft. But it also removes a physical connection a pilot has to his or her vehicle. “When you’re flying off soft keys on a touch screen, it’s a totally different feel,” says Isaacman. “A lot of muscle memory is lost.” Isaacman is a licensed jet pilot. So he knows what he’s talking about. He says moving the stick creates an instant response. But with the touch screen, there’s some delay.
Risks and Rewards
Some emergencies require in-person human action. And they need it right away. Fires can break out. Crew members on Russia’s Mir space station had to battle a blaze in 1997. This can happen when a battery overheats. And there are a lot of batteries aboard the Dragon.

There’s also the risk of depressurization. This is when the air inside the craft changes. Some of it escapes into space. If this happens, crew members need to find the leak. They must seal it off while scrambling into their suits. A launch emergency might happen, too. And the Dragon’s guidance system could fail.
Finally, there are risks in the simple number of days the Inspiration4 crew will spend in orbit. Crews heading for the ISS fly there directly. They are usually aboard within a day or so of launching. The Inspiration4 crew will be in orbit for three days. But the passengers won’t join the ISS. Their craft will orbit above it. Every day on their own will be another day when something can go wrong. 

Ideally, no problems would occur on any mission. So far, SpaceX’s Dragon has made three flights with crews. Nothing major has gone wrong on any of those flights. But space is a dangerous place. The Inspiration4 crew has to be as prepared as possible. 
Isaacman understands the risks. But he feels good about the progress that the Inspiration4 crew has made. “I think we’ve definitely arrived at the point where we’re ready,” he says. “This is going to be a well-executed mission.”

The story “Inside the Crew Dragon”—about the Inspiration4 mission—appears in this week’s issue of TIME for Kids. Neela Sembroski, 9, is the daughter of Inspiration4 astronaut Chris Sembroski. Below, she shares her perspective with TFK readers.

Let me start at the beginning of how my dad became an astronaut. He came upstairs after a call and said, “So, I think I’m going to space!” At first, I was confused. And it feels weird to see my dad in the news. I’ve been feeling a little scared. But it’s also cool when I think about him being blasted into space and floating around. Seeing his rocket booster and the Dragon capsule for the first time has put things into perspective for me. I’ve also gotten to see a rocket launch! Knowing that my dad is one of the next people going into space is mind-boggling. I’m proud of him. He’s always been a space nerd, and this opportunity is a dream come true for him. It’s also awesome that this is the first all-civilian crew. It opens doors for all children—like me!—to be able to go to space someday.

186,186,TFK Explains: Inspiration4,"{'Science', 'Space'}","
This month, four civilian astronauts are scheduled to launch into orbit. They will travel aboard the Crew Dragon spacecraft. Their mission is called Inspiration4. It’s a historic moment in space travel. Here’s what you need to know about it.
Where is the crew going?
The crew members will launch from Kennedy Space Center. It’s in Florida. The Dragon won’t dock at the International Space Station (ISS). It will shoot 80 miles above the ISS. It will circle the Earth at an altitude of 360 miles. When the Dragon returns to Earth, it will splash down off the Florida coast. How long will Inspiration4 be in space?
The mission is scheduled to launch on September 15. It will last for about three days.
Who’s leading the mission?
Jared Isaacman will be the commander. Isaacman started an online payment company in 1999. Today, it’s worth about $7 billion. Isaacman is also a pilot.  
How is SpaceX involved in the mission?
SpaceX is a space exploration company. It was founded by billionaire Elon Musk. SpaceX built the Dragon. In 2020, the company flew NASA astronauts to the ISS. It was the first private company to do so. 
Isaacman paid SpaceX to send the whole crew into space. SpaceX trained the civilian astronauts. It will monitor the mission from Earth.
How is St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital involved?
The Inspiration4 mission hopes to raise $200 million for St. Jude. It also hopes to raise awareness about childhood cancer.
What will the Inspiration4 crew do in space?
Crew members will perform medical experiments in zero-gravity conditions. They will also call loved ones at home and patients at St. Jude. 
Have nonprofessional astronauts been sent to space before?
Yes. Bill Nelson flew on the space shuttle Columbia in 1986. He was a United States congressman. He is now NASA’s administrator. In 2001, Dennis Tito traveled to the ISS. Tito was an American businessman. He paid for the trip. That made him the world’s first space tourist. There have been others, too. But Inspiration4 is the first orbital mission made up entirely of civilians.

Three people will travel with Jared Isaacman on the Inspiration4 mission. Find out below who they are and what they hope to achieve.
Sian Proctor
Sian Proctor, 51, is a professor of geosciences at South Mountain Community College, in Phoenix, Arizona. She was born in Guam. Her father was an engineer. He worked for NASA in Guam during the Apollo 11 mission. That mission resulted in the first moon landing, in 1969. Proctor has a note that the Apollo 11 commander, Neil Armstrong, wrote to her dad: “To Ed—Thanks for the help.”
Proctor is the mission pilot on Inspiration4. She steps in when Isaacman is not at the controls. Her father died in 1989. To thank him, Proctor will take the note from Armstrong with her on the trip. 
Chris Sembroski 
Chris Sembroski, 41, lives in Everett, Washington. He works for the aerospace company Lockheed Martin. 
On Inspiration4, Sembroski is the payload specialist. He oversees cargo and repairs. Isaacman asked him to join the mission. Sembroski had made a donation to St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital and entered the mission lottery. After Isaacman’s call, Sembroski turned to his wife. “I think we’re gonna go ride a rocket,” he said.
Hayley Arceneaux 
When Hayley Arceneaux was 10, she learned she had bone cancer in her left leg. She was treated at St. Jude and now has an artificial knee and a  bone in place of her . Now she’s 29 and a physician assistant at St. Jude.
Arceneaux is the first person with a prosthesis to fly to space. If all goes well, she could change the standards used to judge astronauts. “A girl at the hospital told me that she can’t run or jump,” Arceneaux says. “I told her, ‘I can’t run or jump either. But that’s not stopping me from going to space.’”

The SpaceX Crew Dragon is nearly 27 feet tall. A powerful rocket lifts it into space. Dragon made its first crewed flight in 2020. It will carry Inspiration4 astronauts to space this month. Read on to learn about the parts of the craft.

1. Nose Cone 
This opens to a windowed cupola, where astronauts can see into space. 
2. Capsule 
This is the pressurized section of the craft. It carries the crew. 
3. Windows
4. Side hatch 
5. Engines 
6. 16 thrusters 
These help position the craft. 
7. Modernized instrument panels 
Three large touch screens face the four astronauts. Each screen is capable of calling up 10 sets of displays. 
8. Launch abort system 
This separates the capsule from the rocket in case of emergency. 
9. Heat shield 
10. Unpressurized trunk section 
Half of this is covered in solar panels to provide power. The trunk detaches shortly before reentry. It is also used to hold cargo and has a capacity of 1,300 cubic feet. 
11. Four fins 
These fins are the base of the trunk. They help stabilize the Dragon in the event that the mission must be cut short.

191,191,TFK Kid Reporters: Meet Creedence,"{'People', 'Community'}","
Meet Creedence Peterson, one of the 10 outstanding kids selected to be a TFK Kid Reporter this school year. Creedence is 12 years old and lives in New York City. He loves to build Lego sets, swim, and play flag football on his school team. Creedence also loves science and hopes to be a doctor one day.
Finalists in the TFK Kid Reporter contest were judged on a number of factors. One of their assignments was to write an article about a hometown hero. Creedence's story is about Ashley Whited, a park ranger in New York City. You can read it below. We’ll be introducing the rest of the TFK Kid Reporter squad throughout September.

When COVID-19 hit New York City in March 2020, people could no longer go to schools, gyms, or restaurants, or safely visit friends indoors. But thanks to hometown heroes like Ashley Whited, New Yorkers could still count on one place to safely relax: the city’s parks.

Whited is an urban park ranger for Manhattan. She works mostly in Central Park. Just as doctors and nurses continued to go to work when the pandemic began, so did park rangers like Whited.
“During this pandemic, a lot of spaces in New York were closed,” Whited told TIME for Kids. “Parks served as an alternative space for people to try to continue to live a normal life but also to come and gather safely.”
Besides helping to keep parks open, Whited and other rangers helped keep New Yorkers safe. “We were part of a mask distribution effort,” she says. “We would give reusable masks to people who needed them.” 
They also gave out food. “One of our park distribution sites gave away 3.1 million meals to New Yorkers who needed food and had nowhere else to go,” Whited says.
Whited remembers how frightening it was at the beginning of the pandemic. “We were all concerned about keeping ourselves and New Yorkers safe,” she says. “Knowing we were helping New Yorkers helped us muscle through the curve.”
One of the people Whited helped was 12-year-old Joseph Ruggiero. “I went five times a week to the park to run and play, or just to go on walks,” he says. “The park was very important because it was an open space where I could see my friends.”
Fabian Volpini, 12, also relied on the park. “It was good to get some fresh air instead of being locked up in an apartment,” he says, “considering that the situation in New York was really bad.”
Austin Nelson, 11, says Central Park became a meeting place for relatives. ""The park was the only place we could visit my grandparents before they were vaccinated,"" he says.
During the pandemic, Whited still performed her regular park ranger duties, such as keeping animals safe. When a snapping turtle in Central Park killed a mother duck in May 2020, Whited rescued the ducklings. She spent hours in the duck pond before she scooped them up with a net and transferred them to a sanctuary.
Whited said she feels humbled when people call her a hero. “Not all heroes wear capes,” she says. 
She’s right. Some of them wear park ranger uniforms.

192,192,TFK Kid Reporters: Meet Orlie,"{'People', 'Community'}","
Meet Orlie Weitzman, one of the 10 outstanding kids selected to be a TFK Kid Reporter this school year. Orlie is 12 years old and lives in Chicago, Illinois. In her spare time, she likes to read, write stories and articles, watch movies, and play with her siblings. Orlie says her name means “my light” in Hebrew. 
Finalists in the TFK Kid Reporter contest were judged on a number of factors. One of their assignments was to write an article about a hometown hero. Orlie’s story is about volunteers at a program for refugee families. You can read it below. We’ll be introducing the rest of the TFK Kid Reporter squad this month.

In a church hall on Chicago’s South Side, four girls and three boys giggle as they practice a dance routine. A boy does a flip while a girl performs a ballet move.  
It’s a typical scene of children having fun, but these kids are anything but typical. None of them spoke English until recently. Some are from families that have fled wars, famine, and persecution. Several arrived in the United States amid the COVID-19 pandemic. 
They are participants in a summer camp run by the Hyde Park Refugee Project, a grassroots organization of hometown heroes who help ease the resettlement process for refugee families. “They have had to leave everything they own behind,” Dorothy Pytel, the organization’s founder, told TIME for Kids. She helps coordinate hundreds of volunteers who aid families in finding housing, jobs, healthcare, education, child care, and transportation.
While advocacy groups help shape refugee policy, neighborhood volunteers are crucial in assisting new arrivals with day-to-day challenges. “Without local organizations, refugees would have a much harder time building a new life in the U.S.,” says Jims Porter of Refugee One, an Illinois resettlement agency. 
As well as being fun, the camp helps refugee children sharpen their English. “We saw how the kids were struggling in school,” says Linda Pope, a camp director. “We started this program so they wouldn’t lose their English language skills over the summer.” 
The project began in 2016, when Pytel read an article about refugees. It inspired her to gather a group of Hyde Parkers to help settle a Syrian refugee family in their neighborhood. She recalls picking up the family at the airport. “It was an emotional welcome,” Pytel says. “But they were very relieved to see that there was a group of people waiting for them.” 
The group has helped eight families and was expecting another this month. “It’s been amazing to see the growth of the families and the milestones they’ve achieved,” Pytel says.
Back at the summer camp, the dancers are taking a well-deserved break. “This is my favorite class,” says a girl who arrived in the U.S. in 2018. “Dance helps me express myself.” 
“The project is one of the best things that has happened to Hyde Park in the last decade,” Saba Ayman-Nolley says. She is president of the Hyde Park and Kenwood Interfaith Council, one of the group’s main donors. She says that the Hyde Park Refugee Project’s work “not only helps the refugees but also strengthens our community and makes it a better place.” 
While the project volunteers are heroes, so are the refugees they serve, notes Kailey Love of Refugees International. It’s a humanitarian organization based in Washington, D.C. “Our refugee neighbors are heroes,” she says. “They bring their stories of perseverance and resilience. We can learn from them.”

193,193,Crowd Control,"{'Environment', 'United States'}","
Hugh Kim started planning his summer vacation in March. One destination topped the list: Glacier National Park. That’s in Montana. 
Kim lives in New York City. He reserved his tickets online. He had to be quick. “There were around 4,000 tickets available each day,” he told former TFK Kid Reporter Jeremy Liew in July. “But they’d be gone within five minutes.” Without a ticket, visitors faced long lines. And they could enter parts of the park only after 5 p.m. 
Glacier is one of several United States national parks that used a ticketing system in the spring and summer. The purpose: crowd control. This year, many parks have seen a record number of visitors. In April, about 194,000 people visited Arches National Park, in Utah. That’s a 15% increase from April 2019. Canyonlands National Park is also in Utah. It saw a 30% increase.

The National Park Service (NPS) says the massive crowds are difficult to manage. Visitors are wandering off trails. They are disturbing wildlife. The agency’s mission is to protect America’s natural wonders. But crowds are making that job more challenging than ever. 
Park Problems 
The coronavirus pandemic may explain America’s surging interest in the outdoors. Last summer, many recreational places were closed. But national parks stayed open. People got a chance to “fall in love” with the parks, Michael Childers says. He’s an environmental historian at Colorado State University, in Fort Collins. But “the sheer number of people and cars is overwhelming,” Childers says. 

Some visitors are not following park guidelines. Last year, a ranger at Zion National Park, in Utah, cleaned up 14 pounds of trash. That was in just one small area. Sacred cultural sites near parks have been damaged too. These include petroglyphs, images carved into rocks by  people hundreds of years ago. 

Kelli Jones is a ranger at Grand Canyon National Park, in Arizona. Jones is Navajo. She reminds visitors that the Navajo are one of 11 Native American tribes that call the area home. “The canyon has a cultural connection to the tribes,” she says. 
Setting an Example 
Increased spending by the U.S. government would help the parks, Frank Jahn says. He’s a park ranger at Glacier. “With funding, we could hire more personnel. Then we’d be able to manage the number of people coming in.”

Visitors play a role in protecting parks too. (See “Responsible Tourism.”) “One way to respect sacred land is to be a ,” Jones says. “You should set a positive example for others who visit national parks after you.” 
Reasonable Tourism

The National Park Service has a list of Leave No Trace principles. Here are five tips. Follow them to protect America’s wilderness. 
1. Know the rules for the area you’ll visit.
2. Pack up all trash and leftover food from campgrounds.
3. Do not follow or approach wildlife.
4. Avoid touching cultural or historic structures.
5. Respect other visitors. Protect the quality of their experience.

Hurricane Ida tore through Louisiana and Mississippi on August 29. It was one of the most powerful hurricanes ever to hit the United States. Emergency response crews have been hard at work. 
Winds reached 150 miles per hour. Rain brought major flooding. At press time, four people had died. Many more were injured. 
More than a million homes and businesses lost electricity. Power may not be back for weeks, officials say. “We have a lot of work ahead of us, and no one is under the illusion that this is going to be a short process,” John Bel Edwards says. He’s Louisiana’s governor. 
When the storm was over, temperatures topped 85°F. High humidity made the heat feel worse.
Those who returned home after evacuating have faced challenges. Stephanie Blaise lives in New Orleans, Louisiana. Her power was still out, so she hoped to stay for only a short time. “I’m going to have to convince him to leave,” she said of her father, who came with her. “Can’t stay in this heat.”

Lisa Ratliff has been a crossing guard at Castle Hills Elementary School, in Lewisville, Texas, for the past seven years. As a crossing guard, Miss Lisa doesn’t only keep kids safe. She makes sure everyone who crosses her path has a better day. Miss Lisa is known in the community for smiling and waving at everyone, whether the person is a kid, a parent, or someone just walking by. 
“I love helping others, interacting, and getting involved with all the kiddos,” Miss Lisa told TIME for Kids. “I don’t have any kids of my own, so this is my way of giving back. If I can make the mornings easier and better for everyone, that’s what I want.”
Miss Lisa’s favorite part of being a crossing guard is that “every day, there is a different special moment. I just love watching the little ones grow up and come back to see me. It’s a big family.” She has a special memory of the time a group of kindergartners surprised her with a news team to recognize her for her work.
Avery McCain is a third grader at Castle Hills. She agrees that Miss Lisa is a hometown hero. Avery recalls when she was walking home the wrong way and Miss Lisa saved her. Avery says she doesn’t know where she would have ended up without Miss Lisa’s help.
One of Miss Lisa’s favorite places to go after her crossing-guard shift is Sophia’s Coffee Shop. “There’s not one word that describes Lisa,” says Sophia Lee, the owner of the shop. “You have to go to the foundation to understand why she is such a hero. She genuinely cares for everyone. She makes sure that everyone is okay. She even carries treats for people’s dogs, cats, and even babies that she might encounter. She knows everyone and is so sincere. People in this neighborhood look up to her. She’s a very special person.” 
Miss Lisa also works part-time at a barber shop called The Art of Handsome. Lamar Larry is one of the barbers there. “Lisa is a hero because she is very nice to everyone,” he says. “She's so helpful. She’s just an all-around sweetheart.”
Miss Lisa admits that the pandemic has been challenging for her. She missed seeing some of her kids, and sometimes it was hard to wear a mask out in the heat. She is looking forward to the school year starting back up. She’s already helped some parents of kindergartners learn the new routine.
Without a doubt, everyone at Castle Hills Elementary will be happy to see Miss Lisa’s smiling face this fall. She has inspired so many people and continues to change the world with her positive attitude and concern for others.

201,201,Broadway is Back,"{'Music and Theater', 'Arts'}","
Before the COVID-19 pandemic, Don Darryl Rivera played Iago in Disney’s Broadway show Aladdin. He recently visited his dressing room in New York City. Nothing had changed. “It was exactly how I left it,” he told TIME for Kids. “My room was like a time capsule of right before the shutdown.”

 
Like many other industries, live theater in New York City was hit hard by the pandemic. Many theaters are set to reopen this month. Some have used the time off to make big changes.
On With the Show
The Actors’ Equity Association represents actors and stage managers in the United States. Kate Shindle is its president. She says the shutdown highlighted outdated theater traditions. “It has given us a chance to look at how our business works and the places we can make improvements,” she says. For example, the group wants to see more . “Our industry has historically provided more opportunities to white people than to ,” Shindle says. Actors’ Equity encourages productions to hire diverse actors and stylists.  
Theater companies are also making spaces more accessible. “We are often dealing with very old, historic, and landmark buildings,” Shindle says. “Their accessibility is not always where we need it to be.” Jujamcyn Theaters has five theaters in New York City. In July, the company said it will increase wheelchair accessibility.
A New York Staple
Nearly 15 million people attended Broadway shows in the 2018–2019 season. That’s according to the Broadway League. The industry earned about $1.8 billion. It was a record high. 

 
Tourists made up 65% of Broadway audiences that season. Broadway’s return “will be a celebrated moment in New York City’s tourism recovery,” Fred Dixon says. He leads the tourism group NYC & Company.  
Rivera is celebrating his return to the Broadway stage. “There’s just nothing like the magic and the electricity of live theater,” he says.

202,202,The Kid Report: Broadway is Back,"{'Music and Theater', 'Arts'}","
The story “Broadway is Back”—about the reopening of live theater in New York City—appears in this week’s issue of TIME for Kids. Below, TFK Kid Reporter David Murtagh shares his perspective. David writes about his conversation with Broadway historian Jennifer Tepper.

Broadway theaters were forced to close their doors in March 2020. Many are just now reopening. This is the first time that theaters have had to close for so long. I spoke to Broadway historian Jennifer Tepper. “Broadway has shut down before,” she said. “But it has usually been [for] a day or two. . . . In fact, during the most recent [big] pandemic before COVID-19—the 1918 influenza pandemic—Broadway didn’t shut down at all.” She told me that Broadway did temporarily shut down following the attacks of September 11, 2001. It reopened two days later.
In the past year, some shows were made available online and through streaming services. This allowed audiences everywhere to enjoy Broadway.

203,203,8 Questions for Samuel Ramsey,"{'Science', 'Earth Science'}","
Samuel Ramsey, or Dr. Sammy, works for the United States Department of Agriculture. He’s an entomologist. That’s a scientist who studies insects. TFK’s Rebecca Katzman spoke with Dr. Sammy about his job and what insects can teach us.
1. How did you become an entomologist?
I have been interested in entomology since I was a little kid. At first, I was terrified of insects. But reading about them changed that. 
2. What are you working on now?
My current work is focused on keeping bees healthy. I use a microscope to examine sick ones. I’m developing medicines for them. 
3. Do you have a favorite insect?
I have several. My favorite vegetarian insect is the honeybee. My favorite predatory insect is the praying mantis. Incredible things can come in small packages.  
4. What do insects teach us about ourselves?
We like to think that humans are unique. We think no other creatures form tight-knit communities. But insects like ants, wasps, bees, and hornets were forming closely connected communities before we ever did. 
5. What if I’m afraid of insects?
Learn more about them! You’ll see that their motivations are similar to ours. Crickets used to keep me up at night. I hated it. Then I realized that’s their way of telling other crickets, “Hey, I’m lonely, and I want to hang out with you.” 
6. What about bugs that bite?
They’re just hungry. Take mosquitoes. They’re not trying to make you itch. They’re just getting a little bit of blood from you, because it’s a source of nutrients. They need the protein to have babies.
7. What’s the best way for kids to study insects? 
Do an insect scavenger hunt in the backyard. Books can help you identify these creatures and learn about their ecosystems.
8. Any final message for our readers?
The field of entomology needs diversity. For a long time, it has been dominated by white men. When you bring in diversity, you’re able to solve problems in new ways. Entomology is the study of diversity. Insects are a diverse group. If you want to learn about diversity, learn about insects.

204,204,TFK Kid Reporters: Meet Ronak,"{'People', 'Community'}","
Meet Ronak Bhatt, one of the 10 outstanding kids selected to be a TFK Kid Reporter this school year. Ronak is 11 years old and lives in Alpharetta, Georgia. He looks up to Elon Musk and hopes to interview him one day. Ronak also hopes to become a cardiologist.
Finalists in the TFK Kid Reporter contest were judged on a number of factors. One of their assignments was to write an article about a hometown hero. Ronak’s story is about food-pantry director Melody Fortin. You can read it below. We’ll be introducing the rest of the TFK Kid Reporter squad this month.

Have you ever needed help and found somebody to help you solve your problem? Did that person wear a cape? Probably not, and neither does Melody Fortin. But even without a cape, Fortin is a superhero to more than 4,000 families. 
Fortin works for North Fulton Community Charities (NFCC), an organization that helps families in need. According to its website, the NFCC’s mission is “to help ease hardship and foster financial stability in our community.” As the director of the group’s food pantry, Fortin works tirelessly to ensure the food pantry has enough volunteers, food donations, and technical support to get families what they need when they need it. 
According to FeedingAmerica.org, there are 10.7 million children in the United States who suffer from food insecurity. Families need help for various reasons. Some don’t make enough money to buy food. Others can’t buy food when an unexpected cost occurs. “We help people from all backgrounds,” Fortin told TIME for Kids. “You can never tell just by looking at someone that they might need help getting food.” 
Melissa Morgan, a real-estate agent, leads food or clothing drives for NFCC twice a year. “I chose NFCC because they are a local charity that focuses on the needs of those I live with here in North Fulton,” she says. 
Fortin started as a volunteer with NFCC 13 years ago. She became a staff member seven years ago. Her job is to make sure the pantry gets what it needs, from donations to volunteers. Her favorite memory is of teaching an elderly woman how to use a computer to order food. “The lady never used a computer before I taught her how to do it, and now whenever she comes in, she wants to hug me,” Fortin says. Her work can be hard, but she is passionate about helping families and ensuring they feel respected. 
Coronavirus has not stopped Fortin. During the pandemic, people were not allowed to enter the building. She created a Google Doc so families could choose food, submit their order, and pick it up when it was ready. This ingenious idea kept the NFCC going throughout the pandemic. It has not closed once.
Ellen Adolph is a volunteer at the food pantry. She says that Fortin “is the most compassionate person you will ever meet. Sometimes, it's hard to see what people really need, but Melody has the ability to sense it and give people the exact assistance they need at the time they need it. She is one of the most hardworking people I know."" 
Fortin is a true hometown hero, and this town is lucky to have her.

205,205,Back in Class,"{'Culture', 'United States'}","
All across the country, kids have returned to classrooms. This is usually an exciting time. But this year, the excitement is again mixed with uncertainty. 
“I’m wondering if school will be back to normal,” says Sebastian Taylor Bastidos, 10. He’s from Franklin, Tennessee. He spoke with TIME for Kids in July. In the winter, Sebastian and many of his classmates got sick with COVID-19. They had to stay home. They were separated from friends and teachers.   

Now the country is facing a new strain of the coronavirus. It’s called the Delta .  (See “A Changing Virus.”) It’s spreading, just as kids are returning to in-person classes. This could be a big problem where large numbers of people have not been vaccinated. As of August 11, only about 50% of Americans ages 12 and up were fully vaccinated.  
Educators are cautious. But they’re ready to get back to the classroom. Tonya Bozeman is superintendent of Conecuh County Schools. That’s in Alabama. “Even though we have another variant out there,” she says, “I look forward to having a successful school year.” 
A New Normal 
In December 2020, the first COVID-19 vaccines were approved for emergency use in the United States. Many hoped life would return to normal. That included getting kids back to classrooms. 
 

On July 9, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) urged schools to reopen in the fall. Educators say school disruptions may have caused students to fall behind. A study published in April questioned caregivers. They believed separation from classmates affects kids’ emotional well-being. 
“Students have been behind a computer for a year,” U.S. secretary of education Miguel Cardona told TFK in the spring. “They need to be around their friends.” 

 
But getting back to normal takes time. Christine Alvarado teaches seventh grade at Harriet Tubman Elementary School in Chicago, Illinois. Alvarado frequently asks students how they’re feeling. “Some are excited to be back. Some are nervous,” she says. “However they’re feeling is okay. We’ve all been through a lot.”
Staying Flexible
As the Delta variant surges, districts might have to change plans. Some might offer families the option of remote learning. 

 
Currently, kids under 12 can’t get the vaccine. They could be able to do so this year. Experts say vaccinating them is a step toward beating the virus. In the meantime, the CDC is urging all people in school to wear masks indoors.
Maryam Sodal, 8, is from Denver, Colorado. She says learning during the pandemic is like riding a scooter: “If you fall down, it can be hard.” But if you’re , “it’s pretty easy to get back up.”
A Changing Virus

By late July, the Delta variant was responsible for more than 93% of new COVID infections in the U.S. That’s according to the CDC. Delta is almost twice as contagious as the original coronavirus.
Viruses can change over time. New variants arise. There are now several coronavirus variants. 
Our understanding of these viruses is changing, too. This is why it’s important to keep up with the latest guidance from health experts.

207,207,Water Shortage,"{'Environment', 'United States'}","
The United States government has declared a water shortage on the Colorado River. The announcement came on August 16. The shortage is the result of a drought in the Southwest. Scientists say it is one of the worst droughts in 1,200 years.
The Colorado River supplies water to homes and farms. Starting next year, the amount of water supplied to Arizona, Nevada, and parts of Mexico will be reduced. Farmers in Arizona will see the biggest decreases, about 20%. 
Water from melting snowcaps is drying up before it reaches the river. That’s because of extreme hot weather. Lake Mead is the largest reservoir on the Colorado River. When the year ends, it may only be 34% full. If its levels continue to fall, the government could cut the water supply even further. 
Tanya Trujillo works for the U.S. Department of the Interior. She says local communities will have to work together to conserve resources. “Now is the time to take action,” she says.

210,210,A Day of Remembering,"{'United States', 'History'}","
The attacks that happened on September 11, 2001, have been called the worst in United States history. This year is the 20th anniversary of that terrible day. The nation will honor the nearly 3,000 people who lost their lives.
The attacks were carried out by a group that wanted to harm the U.S. Its members took control of four airplanes. They flew two planes into the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in New York City. Another plane crashed into the Pentagon military headquarters, in Washington, D.C. The fourth plane crashed near Shanksville, Pennsylvania.

Lasting Effects
“Those events shaped so much of our world today,” Noah Rauch told TIME for Kids. Rauch works at the 9/11 Memorial & Museum. That’s in New York City. 
After the attacks, the U.S. invaded Afghanistan. That’s where the group that carried them out was based. This led to what’s often called the longest war in U.S. history. 
Security in public places has become more common since 2001. There were no full-body scanners at airports before then. Now people go through complicated security checks at airports, museums, and concerts. 
Islamophobia has also increased. That is a fear of Muslim people, who practice the religion of Islam. It comes from a wrongful association of all Muslims with the 9/11 attacks. Muslims in the U.S. sometimes face  based on their religion.

Never Forget 
On September 11, 2021, a ceremony will take place at each 9/11 site. The night before, lanterns will be lit near Shanksville. This will honor the 40 passengers and crew who died there. At the Pentagon, in Washington, D.C., 184 benches have been built. That’s one for each victim of the attacks. And in New York City, the names of 2,983 victims will be read aloud. Two columns of light will beam into the sky.

The story “A Day of Remembering”—about the anniversary of the September 11, 2001, attacks on the United States—appears in this week’s issue of TIME for Kids. Below, TFK Kid Reporter Bellen Woodard shares her perspective. Bellen writes about an art project she created in honor of the Survivor Tree.

In October 2001, a tree was found in the wreckage at the World Trade Center in New York City. It was burned and damaged. The tree was nursed back to health and planted at the 9/11 Memorial. The Survivor Tree is a symbol of enduring hope. It shows the will of living things to overcome even the toughest times. In honor of the 20th anniversary of the September 11 attacks, I did an activity. I made a leaf out of paper. Then I wrote a message of hope on it. Learning about September 11 and thinking about the people who lost their lives always makes me sad. This activity gave me a chance to think about the resilience of the survivors.

216,216,Dr. Leana Wen Talks with TIME for Kids,"{'People', 'Health'}","
Kids all across the United States want to return to a “normal” school experience. But the Delta variant, a new strain of the virus that causes COVID-19, is making this a challenge. How can kids safely return to in-person learning? And how does getting vaccinated keep people healthy and protect them from COVID-19?
I spoke with Dr. Leana Wen. She answered my questions and told me about her career in public health. Dr. Wen is an emergency physician; a public health professor at George Washington University, in Washington, D.C.; a contributing columnist for the Washington Post; and an author. A Chinese immigrant, she overcame adversity with hard work and a determination to help people.
Read part of my conversation with Dr. Wen below.

TFK Kid Reporter Abby Rogers:
Thank you so much for speaking with me today. 
Dr. Leana Wen:
Thank you, Abby. It’s great to join you. 
Abby:
Can you explain your job to me? As an emergency physician and a public health advocate, what do you do?
Dr. Wen:
I do a number of things. One is that I treat patients. I work as an emergency physician. I also teach. I’m a professor at George Washington University. In the time of COVID-19, all of my work has become about the coronavirus pandemic, because this is the most serious public health threat that’s facing us. I help people understand how to think about our risk. So, especially now that we have the Delta variant, there are lots of changes about who should wear masks again. A lot of my job is helping people to navigate those types of decisions.
Abby:
I’m hearing that the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine might be approved for 5- to 11-year-olds this fall. Is that true? And what advice do you have for kids like me, who are a few weeks from turning 12? Which vaccine should we get?
Dr. Wen:
Well, first of all, happy early birthday to you. That’s very exciting. 
There are two vaccines—the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines here in the U.S.—that are approved for people 12 and older. Both of these vaccines are found to be very safe, very effective in preventing COVID-19.
Now, in terms of when the FDA may say that younger kids are able to receive the coronavirus vaccines, it does appear that it’s going to be sometime this fall. I don’t know exactly when. A lot of this will depend on research studies. We don’t want to hurry the research. We want the research to be done very thoroughly. We want to see those results, and then we’ll wait for the vaccines to be authorized. 
I am really eager for younger children to be able to get the vaccines because I’m the mom of two little kids. I have a son who turns 4 this month. And I have a daughter who is just 1. It might take a little bit longer for kids their age to get the vaccine. It certainly will give me peace of mind once I know that my children are able to be protected by the vaccine.
Abby:
How can kids safely return to in-person learning?
Dr. Wen:
We now know from the last year and a half that there are ways for schools to be some of the safest places for children, from a coronavirus standpoint. The way that I like to think about it is as layers. Imagine that it’s really cold outside. You want to put on multiple layers. That’s what’s going to keep you warm. Well, it’s a similar case when it comes to preventing coronavirus in any setting, including a school. So for example, if everybody is wearing masks, that provides a really good layer of protection. If the kids are 12 and older and they’re able to be vaccinated, and everybody’s vaccinated, that also provides a really good level of protection. Then you have other layers that help, as well. For example, some type of distancing. Even if you can’t keep six-feet distancing, three-feet distancing helps. Or testing. Having testing every week, or testing twice a week, will be something that’s helpful, as well. 
Abby:
Now that the Delta variant is spreading so quickly throughout the United States, will it be more challenging for students to return to school safely?
Dr. Wen:
Unfortunately, yes. The Delta variant is the most contagious variant of coronavirus that we have seen. It spreads to more people. The individuals who get infected with the Delta variant carry more virus. And so it looks like it can just spread faster and to more individuals. What that means is that the activities that we thought were safer before now have a higher likelihood of [spreading] coronavirus if people are unvaccinated. 
Abby:
How do you educate kids and families so they’re comfortable getting the vaccine?
Dr. Wen:
Getting information about the vaccine is really important. And getting accurate information is even more important, because we have already seen in this pandemic what happens when there are people spreading inaccurate information. That leads to a lot of fear, to confusion, and to people not getting something that actually will save their lives, help students get back at school, help our economy, and just help all of us get back to normal. 
Now, I think one very trusted source of information for parents and for kids is the pediatrician. We trust our pediatrician with other aspects of our lives. We go to the pediatrician for questions about many other illnesses and to care for us. The pediatrician is someone who understands our family, our children. That is always a good person to go to for information. 
And then beyond that, the American Academy of Pediatrics. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Their websites also contain very good information that’s accurate and that’s helpful for parents and children to make the best decisions about the vaccine.
Abby:
In your latest book, you talk about why you chose to go into public health. Can you tell me a little about that?
Dr. Wen:
I talk [in the book] about my own journey. I’m an immigrant: My parents and I came to the U.S. just before I turned 8. Early on, I was one of those annoying kids who always knew that I wanted to go into medicine, specifically to go into the ER [emergency room]. But then it was actually [in] working in the ER that I saw how much it’s not just medicine that so many of our patients need. 
I remember that I had a patient who was 8 years old, who came in all the time to the ER, which is not a good thing. When you’re an ER doc, you don’t want to see the same patient over and over again. He came in all the time with asthma. But he didn't need a new inhaler or new medications. What was happening was that he and his mother were experiencing homelessness. They were going in between different shelters where people around them smoked, and the smoke was triggering his asthma. And they were living in a place at some point where their apartment was okay, but the apartments next to them were filled with mold. And that mold was actually the issue. 
What he needed wasn’t medication. It was housing. Housing is also part of healthcare. And public health helps to address these issues.
Abby: 
What is it like being in public health during the COVID-19 pandemic?
Dr. Wen:
There’s a saying that public health saved your life today, you just don’t know it. Often, the world of public health is invisible. By definition, you don’t see something that has been prevented. That’s what public health is. For example, when I was the health commissioner in Baltimore, we did all these food safety inspections. You may hear about someone who has food poisoning, but not all the thousands of restaurant inspections that prevented food poisoning in the first place. 
And so it’s been really hard, frankly, to be in public health during COVID-19. Public health depends on public trust. When different people are saying different things and we’re asking the public to do hard things that they didn’t use to do—like wearing a mask, or being quarantined, or not going to school during certain times—it’s really hard. 
I think if there’s anything that we’ve all learned during the pandemic, it’s how much we’re all in this together. And that the work of public health depends on each and every one of us.
Abby:

217,217,Mattel Honors Frontline Workers,"{'Culture', 'Health'}","
Mattel is honoring frontline workers with dolls modeled on real-life doctors and nurses. Among them is a doll version of Amy O’Sullivan. She’s a nurse at the Wyckoff Heights Medical Center. That’s in Brooklyn, New York. O’Sullivan appeared on the cover of TIME last year. The doll has hand-painted tattoos, silver hair, and colorful socks like those O’Sullivan wears to work every day.
O’Sullivan was touched by these details. “I used to get a hard time from the administrators about my tattoos and my hair and my pants being rolled up,” she says. “But I didn’t want to be like anyone else. . . . I had no role models when I was growing up. This, I think, shows kids it’s okay to be different. It encourages them to be themselves.”

There are five other dolls in the program. One is modeled on Dr. Audrey Sue Cruz, from Las Vegas, Nevada, who fights racial bias against Asian-American physicians. Another is for Dr. Chika Stacy Oriuwa, from Canada, who is fighting racism in the healthcare system. Next is Sarah Gilbert, a professor in the United Kingdom who helped develop a COVID-19 vaccine. There’s a doll for Dr. Jaqueline Goés de Jesus, a researcher who led work around the COVID-19 variant in Brazil. And there is Dr. Kirby White, from Australia. She developed reusable personal protective equipment, or PPE, for doctors.
Each woman was presented with her own one-of-a-kind doll. The tribute dolls are not for sale, but Mattel announced it will donate $5 to the First Responders Children’s Program for every doctor, nurse, or paramedic Barbie sold at Target. Mattel launched the campaign last year to give back to communities in need. “This fall, admittedly, we thought we would be further along in the pandemic,” Lisa McKnight says. She’s a senior vice president at Mattel and the global brand manager for Barbie. “But it was important to honor these amazing medical workers across the globe as we continue to face a difficult time.”

A summer day is the perfect time to chill out with a good book. TFK Kid Reporters have reviewed some of the hottest books of the season. Below, TFK Kid Reporter Rory Hu shares her thoughts on War and Millie McGonigle, by Karen Cushman. Check back next week for another review. 

It’s 1941. Millie McGonigle is 12 years old. She was supposed to be living a carefree life in the beautiful Mission Beach neighborhood of San Diego. Instead, she lives in the shadow of World War II. War and Millie McGonigle, by Karen Cushman, is an inspiring story that tackles the topics of life and death. We can all learn a lot from it. The story line is not driven by dramatic plot twists, but by vivid characters and their relationships. The dynamic between Millie and her little sister, Lily, mirrors the real-life sibling relationships in many families. I give War and Millie McGonigle a 9½ out of 10.

220,220,Skateboarding Stars,"{'Sports', 'World'}","
TOKYO, JAPAN—Skateboarding’s newest stars are two 13-year-old girls.
Japan’s Momiji Nishiya, 13, made history on Monday. At the Tokyo 2020 Games, she took home the first women’s street skateboarding Olympic gold medal. Standing next to her on the podium was Rayssa Leal, also 13, from Brazil. Rayssa earned silver in the event. Japanese skater Funa Nakayama, 16, took bronze.
Momiji’s win comes a day after 22-year-old Japanese skater Yuto Horigome won gold in the men’s event. It cements Japan’s status as a skateboarding powerhouse.
The women’s skateboarding final was a huge moment for these Games. Some of the Olympics’ youngest competitors displayed impressive tricks and brutal wipeouts on an international stage.
Half of the skaters in the finals lineup were younger than 18. In Tokyo’s scorching heat, they were determined to land their best tricks. They managed to fill the mostly empty skatepark with joy as hip-hop thumped in the background.
The few spectators at the Ariake Urban Sports Park witnessed some big surprises on Monday. World Number 1–ranked Pamela Rosa, 22, was seen as Brazil’s most likely medal hopeful. But she didn’t even make it to the final. Aori Nishimura, 19, the Number 3–ranked female street skateboarder, came in eighth after falling several times.
After winning gold, Momiji was asked what she wanted to tell young skaters. “Skateboarding is fun and interesting,” she told TIME. “I hope everyone can give it a try.”

And this young group is already offering powerful inspiration for a new generation of skaters. Outside of the skateboarding venue, 9-year-old Keito Ota and 8-year-old Ayane Nakamura were eagerly waiting to catch a glimpse of the newly minted Japanese medalists. The two friends started skateboarding about a year ago. They arrived at the park wearing Team Japan skateboarding shirts. Every time a bus left the venue, they pressed themselves against the metal fences, holding up pieces of paper that said, “Thank you for your hard work” and “Congratulations on your gold medal.”
Keito says he’s adding Momiji and Funa to his list of favorite skateboarders. “I am their fan now,” he said, as he slid around on his skateboard. In August, Keito will enter his first competition at a local skateboarding student cup.
Just 13 years and 330 days old at the time of her win, Momiji is Japan’s youngest-ever gold medalist. She’s one of the youngest in Olympics history. That record, though, goes to American diver Marjorie Gestring. Gestring took the gold medal at the 1936 Berlin Games at the age of 13 years and 267 days. At age 13 years and 203 days, Leal would have set a new record had she finished first.
Momiji always gets rewards from her mother after competitions. She told reporters she looks forward to having yakiniku, Japanese-style grilled meat.

221,221,"Ready, Set, Sail!",{'Environment'},"
This spring, 12 sailing teams from around the world competed in the first-ever Ocean Race Europe. The race set off from Lorient, France, on May 29. Teams of six to 10 people spent 22 days sailing the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea to the finish line, in Genoa, Italy. That’s where the race ended, on June 19. 
Two classes of speedy sailboats raced in the event: the IMOCA and the VO65. Offshore Team Germany won the IMOCA class race. And Portugal’s Mirpuri Foundation Racing Team won the VO65 class. 
Annie Lush is a crew member of Offshore Team Germany. “It took a while to sink in that we had won!” she told TIME for Kids. This competition marks the first time that Germany has won an Ocean Race in 18 years. “It’s a big step for Germany,” Lush says. “And it’s great to see the excitement the race has generated.” 
“The whole crew has been fantastic,” says Yoann Richomme, captain of Portugal’s winning team. “There’s a lot of talent in that crew, and we managed to use it as best as we could.”

Inside the Race
The Ocean Race Europe is an offshoot of the Ocean Race, which goes around the world. The first Ocean Race was held in 1973 as the Whitbread Round the World Race. Since then, it has taken place every three or four years. 
While the Ocean Race Europe covered less area than the round-the-world version, it presented plenty of challenges. Teams were on their boats for three straight weeks. “When you’re on board, all you do is race, eat, and sleep,” says Richard Brisius, chairman of the Ocean Race. “There is no Internet connection and there are no movies.” There isn’t even a fridge or a freezer inside the boat. These appliances weigh a boat down, and a heavier boat won’t sail as fast as a lighter one. So crew members rely on freeze-dried food for nourishment during the long race. 
Brisius says that “as a crew member, you have to be very physically and mentally fit” to handle all the hurdles that come with competing. 
The Ocean Race Europe has a larger purpose. It aims to raise awareness about ocean sustainability. During the race, free-floating drifter buoys collect scientific data from the salty waters. They measure surface temperature, ocean carbon dioxide levels, microplastics levels, and more. 
The data is shared with scientists. It provides insight about how the ocean is affected by climate change. Scientists use the data to further understand and advocate for the world’s changing environment and seas.
“The ocean doesn’t have a voice of its own,” Brisius says. “So it’s our job to speak up for it.”
Parts of a Sailboat 
A sailboat moves by using the power of the wind. Sailboats have many parts that work together to catch the wind and propel the boat forward. Take a look!

222,222,Kids Care About: Sea Turtles,"{'Environment', 'Animals'}","
TFK Kid Reporter Sophia Hou cares about sea turtles. She talked to experts about why these animals are in danger and how people can help.

Sea turtles live in coastal areas and open waters all over the world. Six species live in United States waters. All of them are vulnerable, endangered, or critically endangered.

Ashleigh Bandimere is the sea turtle program coordinator at the Oceanic Society. I asked her what the greatest threat to sea turtles is. She said it’s industrial-scale fisheries. Marine animals like sea turtles get caught in nets intended to catch other animals. Ghost gear, or abandoned gear, also entangles the reptiles.
And sea turtle populations have been affected by climate change. It has caused more storms and a rise in sea levels. These have destroyed nesting habitats.

Coastal development has affected sea turtles, too. Pollution harms the animals. Vehicles pack down beach sand. This makes it hard for female sea turtles to dig nests. And lights from buildings and roads confuse the hatchlings and lead them away from the ocean. “Very few sea turtle hatchlings will make it to adulthood, so each adult turtle is extremely special,” Bandimere says. “One turtle will be responsible for laying thousands of eggs every few years.”

Many people and organizations are working to reverse the decline in sea turtle populations. Leigh Henry is director of wildlife policy at the World Wildlife Fund (WWF). She told me that WWF “works with fisheries to help them switch to more turtle-friendly fishing hooks and nets.” She also says installing LED lights inside of nets can help “alert sea turtles to their presence,” so the animals can swim around them.
What does the future hold for sea turtles? Bandimere is confident we can save them. “We know what threats they face,” she says. “And we know what’s needed to eliminate or decrease these threats. It’s just a matter of making it happen.”

You Can Help, Too
Here are five ways you can help sea turtles.
Avoid single-use plastic.
Pick up trash on the beach. Dispose of it properly.

Flatten old sand castles and fill in holes in the sand. That way, female sea turtles will have a place to dig their nests and hatchlings will have a clear path to the water.
Turn off flashlights on the beach during nesting season so hatchlings are not confused.
Don’t buy souvenirs made of sea turtle shells.

In the fifth and final part of our series of essays from kids, you’ll hear from Rory, in California; Shanaya, in Tennessee; and Carolina, in New York. They experienced loneliness and isolation during the pandemic. Now, all of them are looking ahead and fighting for a bright future—one where COVID-19 will be history!

TFK Kid Reporter Rory Hu, age 11
Cupertino, California

Blame the Avengers. They took the Infinity Stones, altered the flow of time, and turned the world upside down. Seriously, 2020 felt so strange. It was as if we had entered a parallel timeline. Everything around me has gone virtual: virtual school, virtual playdates, virtual birthday parties. This virtual world made me feel anxious, lonely, and bored, at first. Then it hit me that this past year, my family has had a chance to spend more time together than ever before. Same with my friends. For example, I had no idea about a friend’s artistic skills until we began collaborating on a Zoom whiteboard. Although the real distance was very great, we got much closer virtually.
The world is as real as before, if not more so, despite all the virtual activity. The issues around me, such as the California wildfires and Asian hate crimes, are very real, even though I learned about them online. The pandemic is not the only battle we are fighting. It’s time to get real and stand up for our future.

Shanaya Pokharna, age 12
Memphis, Tennessee

I had never imagined that at age 12, I would be witness to something so unusual, something that would become history: a pandemic, something people only hear about in textbooks. Unimaginable, unfathomable, unforgettable is how I describe 2020.   
This was a year full of emotions. My mother was sick in an isolated room for 20 days. She got COVID-19 when the world was waking up to “just another flu” in early March. My father is an infectious-disease physician. He tirelessly cared for COVID patients in inundated hospitals, navigating the lack of supplies and finally contracting the disease himself. 
So, 2020 has matured me by a few years. From my parents and the people around me, I learned the virtues of compassion, patience, hard work, selflessness, dedication, gratefulness, and passion toward one’s profession and family. There are so many things we take for granted. But 2020 made me realize how important these things are.

Carolina Caraballo, age 11
Bronx, New York

A year ago, I said goodbye to my life as I knew it and hello to the infamous year in quarantine: 2020, the year I will never forget, a year full of changes I'm still getting used to.
As a student, I was asked to change how I learn. When quarantine began, I was midway through fifth grade. From one day to the next, my bedroom, kitchen, and dining table became my classroom. I had to learn how to learn on a screen. Online learning had its perks, and was even exciting at first. You can’t beat the comfort of being home. However, the seemingly endless Zooms got old real quick. Top that with feelings of loneliness and isolation, and I had had enough of remote learning a month in. No amount of screen time could make up for in-person interactions with friends.
I am now in the sixth grade and have returned to school in person two days a week. Returning has been an interesting and different experience. Oh, who am I kidding? It’s been plain weird! But I'm grateful that I get to see teachers and friends face-to-face. 
I keep reminding myself that 2020 will make for great stories to look back on when we are older. I had a socially distanced 11th birthday. I had endless family time. I learned how to make scrambled eggs, pancakes, banana bread, and cake from scratch.
My mind hasn’t fully wrapped itself around all that is now part of my history. Twenty years from now, a kid just like me will be learning about what I went through, in a history class. I think that’s pretty amazing!

Zaila's winning word: Murraya. That’s a type of tropical tree commonly referred to as orange jasmine. Zaila's victory came in the competition’s 18th round. Upon being declared the winner, she jumped up down, did a few spins, and pumped her fists in the air as confetti rained down on the stage. 
“It felt, like, really good to become a winner,” Zaila told Good Morning America on Friday. “To finally have it, like the best possible outcome, was really good.” 
Zaila outspelled 10 other contestants in the bee finals, which took place near Orlando, Florida. For her effort, she received a trophy and $50,000 in cash and prizes.
In addition to being a star speller, Zaila is a basketball player with three Guinness World Records for dribbling. She began competing in spelling contests two years ago.

228,228,A Kid's Best Friend,"{'Science', 'Animals'}","
If you have a dog, you probably feel a strong bond with it. A recent study found that this bond may be important to dogs, too. 
Researchers at Oregon State University looked at the relationship between kids and dogs. They recruited 30 young people, ages 8 to 17, who have dogs. 
The kids brought their dogs to an empty, warehouse-like room. There, a kid was asked to walk around the huge space, sometimes pausing or changing direction. “And the dog was left to do whatever the dog wanted to do–run around the room, or sniff, or lie down and take a nap,” says Monique Udell, one of the study’s authors. 

 
But most of the time, the dog didn’t do any of those things. Instead, it stayed close and moved similarly to its owner. When the kid walked, the dog usually walked too. When the kid stopped, the dog stopped. When the kid turned and changed direction, so did the dog. The dogs did this far more often than you would expect them to do it by chance. 
What does this mean? Udell says it’s a dog’s way of building a relationship with a human. Dogs did this with kids, even though adults are usually the ones who feed and care for pets. “The kid may play a sibling role in the life of the dog,” Udell says. “This implies those bonds are important to them.” 

 
So far, Udell’s team has focused on dogs. But the researchers would like to do similar studies with cats and other types of pets. Udell suspects that the animal-human bond extends to them, as well.

234,234,Greatest of All Time,"{'United States', 'Sports'}","
She’s won seven national championships, 19 world titles, and five Olympic medals, four of them gold. Her leotards are already decorated with a rhinestone goat (a nod to her ""greatest of all time,"" or GOAT, status). Is there anything left for gymnast Simone Biles to prove?
For most people, the answer would be no. But Simone Biles is not like most people, or even most Olympians. The 24-year-old from Spring, Texas, is not only the most dominant gymnast of her time. She’s likely the greatest in history. 
With an unmatched blend of skill, power, and daring, Biles has won every all-around national, world, and Olympic competition she has entered since 2013. Her record haul of 25 World Championship medals is five more than that of her closest rival. Biles has four gymnastics skills named after her. This honor is reserved for the first person to execute a new move in a major international competition. And she has a fifth that she is likely to unleash at the Tokyo Games. It’s a gravity-defying vault. Only male gymnasts have completed it on the Olympic stage.
“She is superhuman,” says Jordyn Wieber, an Olympic gymnast and the head women’s gymnastics coach at the University of Arkansas. “She could be doing the exact same routines [she did] in Rio and still win. Yet she is challenging herself, constantly competing against herself.”
New Approach
Biles’s determination was tested after the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, in 2016. She took a year off afterward. She never once set foot in the gym. Instead, she rested her body. She prepared mentally for another Olympics. And she dealt with the challenges of her newfound fame. (She also moved out of her parents’ house and learned how to run a dishwasher.)
When her longtime coach took another job during that year off, Biles saw a chance for a new approach. Cecile and Laurent Landi are both former gymnasts on the French national team. They made the case that they could make Biles even better. “They start with the basics, and focus on the root basics before the big skills, which I never really did before,” Biles says. “I had stopped working on the basics. But it went smoother than I thought it would.”

Laurent Landi’s first task was to build Biles’s confidence on uneven bars, her weakest event. They worked to make her swings and catch-and-release skills more consistent. “I definitely don’t hate bars anymore,” she says. “And I trust myself a little bit more.”
He also pushed her to try the triple twisting double salto on-floor exercise. That’s two backward flips while twisting three times before landing. Biles had mentioned that she used to try the move for fun, knowing she could land in the safety of the foam pit. “He said, ‘I think you can do another twist. Just try it and let’s play with it. And in a few months, I think it might work,’” Biles says. “I was like, ‘I don’t think so.’” But Laurent was right. Biles was happily wrong. The skill has since become a highlight of her routine.
To the Limit
Biles is motivated less by scores than the pursuit of her own physical and mental limits. “She is constantly pushing the envelope, pushing herself to do insanely hard skills that I can’t even fathom,” says Wieber.

Biles makes no effort to hide her ambition. Indeed, she embraces it. And that is a key part of her greatness, particularly in a sport with historically few Black women at its highest level. “She is unabashedly Simone in her energy and personality,” says Reuben May, a professor at University of Illinois who studies sports, society, and race. “She has shown that you can be you and still be effective in a world that is unlike you.”
Legacy is not yet on Biles’s mind. Tokyo comes first. But she does welcome being a role model. “I hope I let kids know that it’s okay to say you’re good at something,” she says. “And that it’s okay to be the GOAT.”

Some of the world’s greatest athletic talents will be on display at the Olympics in Tokyo, Japan. Competitors will have a chance to win Olympic medals in four sports new to the Games. Learn about each of these sports, and meet some of the members of Team U.S.A. who'll be competing in them. Get ready to cheer them on!
Sport Climbing
Colin Duffy is 17 years old. He’s been climbing since he was 5. When Colin spoke with TIME for Kids in April, he was busy at home, in Broomfield, Colorado. “It’s getting close to the end of the school year,” he said. And when school ends? First, a few climbing competitions. Then, the big trip: In July, he’ll go to Tokyo. He’ll be the youngest member of Team U.S.A.’s first-ever Olympic sport-climbing team.
“I feel super excited and super blessed to have this opportunity,” Colin says. “It means so much to me, to go down in the history books and be a part of the sport’s first time on the biggest stage.”
Sport climbing’s Olympic debut will include three styles: speed, lead, and bouldering. In the speed contest, two climbers will scurry up a wall. In lead, a climber has six minutes to go as high as possible. And in bouldering, climbers follow fixed routes up a difficult wall.

TFK Kid Reporter Jeremy Liew spoke to one of Colin’s fellow athletes from Team U.S.A., Kyra Condie, from Shoreview, Minnesota. Climbing is an “equally mental and physical” sport, she says. “You have to be problem-solving as you’re competing.”
Athletes have to qualify for the Olympics. Each sport has its own rules for how this is done. Condie says that finding out she had qualified for Team U.S.A. “was a huge relief and a big accumulation of hard work.” 
“It just didn’t feel real,” she says. “Looking back, even though it was almost two years ago at this point, it still doesn’t feel real.”

Like Colin, Condie started training at a young age. So did Nathaniel Coleman, from Utah, and Brooke Raboutou, from Colorado. They’re also part of Team U.S.A. The COVID-19 pandemic delayed the Summer Olympic Games and forced the athletes to train differently. But Colin considers himself lucky. “I was able to climb outside,” he says. “I also have a climbing wall in my basement that I was able to train on.”

The pressure of going for the gold can be difficult. So Colin says he isn’t putting any expectations on himself to win medals. Instead, he’s focused on enjoying his time in Tokyo. 
“Getting to see athletes from all around the world in different sports is going to be a life-changing experience I want to remember forever,” he says. “So that’s my goal: to make the most of it.”
Surfing

For the first time, there’ll be surfing at the Olympics. And surfers won’t just be competing against one another: They’ll also be competing against the ocean. Part of a surfer’s score will depend on the difficulty of the wave he or she chooses to ride. The tougher the wave, the higher the scoring potential. Surfers have 30 minutes, and only their two highest-scoring waves count. So prepare to see athletes waiting for the perfect moment to make their move. 

Team U.S.A. is sending four athletes (plus alternates) to Tokyo to compete. Big things are expected from Carissa Moore. The 28-year-old Hawaiian is a four-time world champion. Eyes will also be on California’s Kolohe Andino, who has won seven U.S.A. Surfing championship titles.
Skateboarding

Skateboarding fans are excited to see the sport make its Olympic debut. This popular activity is fast-paced and gravity-defying. At the Games, athletes may compete on two courses. Park-style events take place in a big concrete bowl, where boarders perform tricks. In street-style events, athletes face stairs, rails, benches, and more.

Karate

Eighty athletes from around the globe are heading to Tokyo to take part in the first-ever Olympic karate competition. There are three kumite, or fighting, categories. There is also one kata category, in which solo participants demonstrate karate forms or techniques.
For kata, the athletes must be precise in their movements. Judges will give competitors a score based on how well they execute the form. 
Tom Scott, from Texas, is one to watch. He’ll be team captain.

236,236,Olympic Climber,"{'United States', 'Sports'}","
Kyra Condie is a 24-year-old sport climber from Saint Paul, Minnesota. She started climbing at a birthday party when she was 10. This summer, she’ll be one of four athletes representing Team U.S.A. in the first-ever Olympic sport-climbing competition. TFK Kid Reporter Jeremy Liew spoke to Condie about the sport, her training techniques, and how she stays focused. 

How would you describe the sport of climbing?
Climbing is difficulty-based. People expect it to be speed-based, but it’s about problem-solving and who can do the hardest, most-complicated moves the fastest.
Can you elaborate on that?
For the Olympics, there is one discipline, speed climbing, that is speed-based. But bouldering and lead are based on difficulty. So it’s the person who gets the farthest on the climbs, not who does it the fastest.
What is your favorite discipline?
My favorite is definitely bouldering, which is difficulty-based. It’s shorter, so you get multiple tries. You can do really complicated, hard movements because of that.
How do you train for bouldering?
I do a lot of strength training. Bouldering has a lot to do with full-body strength.
How else do you train?
My coach and I will make up something really hard, and I’ll try to do it. And then if I don’t do it, I’ll go back into the gym the next day and try it again. So it’s a lot of trying the same moves to improve those strengths.
Is climbing more of a mental or a physical sport?
I think it’s equally a mental and a physical sport. You have to be problem-solving as you’re competing. You have to turn around and figure out what you have to do right away. Sometimes it’s, “Which hand do I go with?” Or, “Where do I move my feet?”
How do you stay focused when you climb?
I’ve been talking to a sports psychologist a lot. She’s helped me figure out how to stay present and focused. You don’t want to be thinking about moves that are four moves ahead of where you are. You want to be thinking about the move you’re doing instead of letting your mind wander ahead.
How did you stay focused on a long-term goal, like qualifying for the Olympics?
Having a lot of self-confidence. Knowing that if I put the work into it, I could accomplish it. Have a lot of confidence in what you’re doing and in what the outcome will be.
How did you feel when you qualified for the Olympics?
It was a huge relief. And also a big accumulation of hard work. I was sobbing. Total, full tears. It just didn’t feel real. Honestly, looking back, even though it was almost two years ago, it still doesn’t feel real.
What is the biggest challenge you’ve ever faced?
When I was 12 years old, I went through back surgery. I have 10 fused vertebrae in my back, which can be really challenging. All of my competitors don’t have that. It can feel really unfair sometimes. But realizing that it’s something unique to me that I have to deal with has really helped. Everybody has something they deal with.
How did COVID impact your training?
I was in Salt Lake City [in Utah], which is where our training center is. We were able to train at the gym the whole time, since it had limited access. That was really lucky.
What advice would you give to new or young climbers?
I think the biggest thing is that basically anybody can climb. I’ve seen 11-year-old girls outclimb professional athletes.
How do you describe your climbing style?
My style is very straightforward because my back can’t get really funky. I can’t do twisty moves, so I’ve had to compensate with strength. I would say mine is really like brute-force style.
I’ll be in Utah later this year to see national parks. Do you have any suggestions?
Zion is absolutely beautiful. I’ve only climbed there a little bit, but I was thoroughly amazed.

237,237,Meet an Athlete,"{'United States', 'Sports'}","
The world’s best athletes with a disability will compete at the Paralympic Games, in Tokyo, Japan, from August 24 through September 5. Nicky Nieves is a Paralympic gold medalist. She’s on the United States Women’s Sitting National Team for volleyball. 
When TFK’s Karena Phan spoke with Nieves, in April, the athlete was in Edmond, Oklahoma, preparing for the Games. Nieves spoke about training during the pandemic, her nonprofit, and her love for volleyball.
How long have you been playing sitting volleyball?
Since 2011. At that time, I was in college, playing [traditional volleyball] for Queens College [in New York].
Then what happened?
The Paralympic team reached out to my athletic director. They were like, “Hey, we see you have an athlete [who] doesn’t have a hand. We want to know if she’d be interested in playing sitting volleyball.” At first, I was hesitant. But I tried it, and I loved it. And I loved it so much that I stuck with it.

What’s your favorite thing about sitting volleyball?
I’ve found my sense of community. When I was growing up, my parents and I never had knowledge of adaptive sports. Now I could talk about little things in life and trying to get better at the sport with people who understood exactly what I was going through. It was a game changer. It felt like I had made another family outside of the one that I already have.
What was it like training during the pandemic?
Training during the pandemic was a nightmare. Usually, when we have a big tournament, we live temporarily at our training site. It’s really useful for me to get advice from my coaches and to be around my teammates. That all changed when the pandemic happened. I ended up being home for a long time. It was difficult to create the same kind of environment at home.
How is training going now?
We got off to a slow start because we’d been away from each other for so long. But now we’re back on the grind for Tokyo.
What’s one thing you’re looking forward to most in Tokyo?
If I’m being honest, I’m looking forward to actually going to Tokyo! I just can’t wait to get there, because then I’ll know it’s real. 

What inspired you to create your nonprofit, Limitless People Inc.?
When I graduated from high school, in 2007, my mom paid for me to play club volleyball. [Club volleyball] helped me tremendously. It got me a college scholarship. However, now it’s ridiculously expensive. I thought, “What would somebody else become, or where would they be, if they had a little bit of the opportunity that I had? Or the resources that I had?” My goal is inclusivity and opportunities.
What is something you want people to know about Paralympic sports?
Just because it’s a Paralympic sport doesn’t mean it’s easier. I wish that, when people looked at Para sports, they’d admire individuals for their athleticism and hard work. Not so much for, like, “Oh, she’s a blind athlete. It’s so inspiring.” No, be inspired because they’re an athlete giving it all that they got, despite the odds. 

What advice do you have for young people?
There are always going to be people who will speak negativity into your life. Regardless of what people say—if a coach, or a parent, or a friend doesn’t think you’re good enough—don’t ever stop. Leave it all out there, so at the end of the day, you can say, “Okay, I gave it my all.”

239,239,A Juneteenth Celebration,"{'Holidays', 'History'}","
On June 19, people across the United States celebrate Juneteenth. The holiday commemorates the ending of slavery in the U.S., in 1865.
Juneteenth is short for “June 19th.” It was on that day, in June 1865, that 250,000 people in Galveston, Texas, found out they had been freed from slavery.  
A Look at History
In 1860 and 1861, several Southern states declared their independence from the United States. This started the Civil War. The Southern Confederacy wanted to maintain slavery, while the Northern Union wanted to stop slavery from spreading to new territories.
On January 1, 1863, President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation. It declared freedom for enslaved people in the Confederacy. White slave owners kept the news a secret. Many enslaved people would not find out they had been freed until more than two years later. 
In April 1865, the Confederacy surrendered to the Union. The war was over. On June 19, Union soldiers arrived in Galveston, Texas, to enforce the president’s order. When they told the crowds that the state’s 250,000 enslaved people were free, celebrations broke out.
Making a Holiday
Over the years, Black people from Galveston moved to different cities, and the celebration spread. It is also called Emancipation Day, or Freedom Day. 
In the 1960s, the civil rights movement brought a wider awareness of Juneteenth. On June 19, 1968, two months after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., a Solidarity Day rally was held on June 19 in Washington, D.C. The event drew 50,000 people. 
Texas made Juneteenth a state holiday in 1980. Following international protests sparked by the May 2020 killing of George Floyd, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Juneteenth has gained even wider recognition. Juneteenth celebrations include religious services, cookouts, parades, and festivals featuring music and dancing.  Now, 48 out of 50 states, plus Washington, D.C., recognize Juneteenth as a state holiday.

240,240,Let's Play,"{'Sports', 'Health'}","
Watching the Olympics might inspire you to try new activities. And summer is a great time to challenge your family and neighbors to a little friendly competition. Here are some ideas for getting your competitive juices flowing. Remember, the most important thing is to have fun!
Ready, Set, Race
There’s nothing more classic than a simple running race. All you need to decide is where the race will start and finish. The race can be as short or as long as you like. Now you’re ready to find out who's the fastest. You can also compete against yourself. Have someone time you as you run. After a quick breather, go again. Can you beat your personal best?
Kick the Ball

Kickball is a summer favorite. All you need to play is—you guessed it!—a big rubber ball. Baseball and softball fields make great kickball fields. But if there isn’t one around, you can make your own. On a street without traffic, use chalk to draw the bases. If you’re playing on grass, old shirts or toys will do the job.
Up and Over

Volleyball is another popular summer sport. Grab a ball and a net, and you’re ready to go. Don’t have a net? Try stringing a jump rope between two poles or trees. For a fun twist, take your game to the water! Volleyball is a great game to play in a shallow pool. In a backyard or park, turn on some sprinklers for an added challenge.
Chalk Games

With just one stick of sidewalk chalk, the possibilities are endless. Draw a hopscotch court for you and your friends. Create a maze for your family to navigate. Or host an animal guessing game: Can someone guess what creature you’re trying to draw?
Toss It In

In the game cornhole, players try to throw beanbags through the holes in wooden or plastic targets. Don’t have beanbags? Little balls, pebbles, or toys are a good substitute. Don't have a cornhole set? Buckets or bowls make fine targets. Focus on improving your accuracy. Soon you might be able to score points with your eyes closed!
Knock 'em Down

You don’t need to go to a bowling alley to enjoy bowling. Try it on the lawn! Pick a patch of grass in your yard or a park. Set up your “pins”: Empty juice bottles work well. Then roll a ball toward them. How many can you knock down at once? Bring paper and a pencil if you want to keep score. Did you topple the pins all in one throw? Strike!
Jump for Joy

With a jump rope, you’re just a hop, skip, and a jump away from hours of good fun and exercise. Ask a friend to time you. How long can you jump without getting tangled? Or give jumping tricks a try. Can you cross and uncross your arms while jumping? Can you spin in a circle? Watch videos of professional jumpers for more trick ideas.
Off to the Races

If you’re tired of classic running races, add a new element. How fast can you run while carrying an egg on a spoon? Don’t drop it! Pillowcases make perfect potato-sack race equipment. Don’t worry if you fall over—that’s half the fun. With enough friends, you can organize relay races. Race against each other or the clock.

241,241,Dr. Anthony Fauci Talks with TIME for Kids,"{'People', 'Health'}","
Kids 12 and older are now able to get the COVID-19 vaccine. What does this mean for summer plans? What does it mean for returning to school in the fall? Should we continue to wear masks? 
As the director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci is the nation’s top infectious-disease expert. He also serves as the chief medical advisor to the president of the United States. 

Recently, I had the opportunity to speak with Dr. Fauci. I had questions about how to stay safe this summer and going back to school in person this fall. Dr. Fauci helped me understand what I can do safely. 

TFK Kid Reporter Afton Campbell:  
Let’s jump right into our questions. 
Kids 12 and over can now get vaccinated. Can they safely attend overnight camp this summer? And can they safely sleep in a tent or cabin with someone who is not vaccinated? 

Dr. Anthony Fauci: 
You know, from the individual standpoint of your safety, the fact that you’re vaccinated and fully vaccinated means the likelihood of you getting infected is extraordinarily low. So you could safely do that. 
But one of the things that could be confusing is that the CDC is trying to get guidelines for camps to keep everyone safe. But as an individual yourself, could you feel comfortable both indoors and outdoors while you’re vaccinated? The answer is yes. 

Afton: 
That’s such a relief to hear. 
Many school districts have announced they won’t have a distance-learning option for the fall. If not all kids are able to be vaccinated by then, how can they stay safe and protect their families from getting sick? 

Dr. Fauci: 
It’s going to depend very much, Afton, on what the level of infection in the community is. That’s always a factor that influences the CDC guidelines. So if, in fact, there’s a degree of infection dynamic in the community, then kids who are not vaccinated, for one reason or another, might prompt the CDC to say, “Yes, we will go to school, everyone will be in person, no more virtual, it will be in-person class—but you’ll have to wear a mask.
But for you, when you go back to school, what would likely happen if the level of infection is so low in the community, the CDC might make the option and the recommendation that they will not necessarily require masks. If we still have a lot of activity, of virus, the CDC may still require some children to be wearing masks depending on the level of virus in the community and the degree of vaccination. 

Afton: 
Do you recommend wearing masks even if other people aren’t at school? 
Dr. Fauci: 
You know, that’s going to be a CDC recommendation, as I mentioned, that will in fact depend on the level of vaccination and the level of infection in the community. 
So the problem, Afton, that the CDC is struggling with is how to make everyone feel safe and protected when you have mixed groups. If you have nobody vaccinated, it’s easy. If you have everybody vaccinated, it’s easy. But when you have mixed groups of people vaccinated and not, there will be the concern that there will be some spread of infection in the school. 

And therefore the CDC might, depending on the level of infection in the community, say that in this particular community, with very low or virtually no infection at all, you shouldn’t have to wear a mask. Whereas someplace else, we have a dynamic of infection. And even though some of the kids are vaccinated, you might still have to wear a mask. So we leave that up to the CDC to make that determination based on the factors that I just mentioned. 

But the one thing that’s interesting is that you, as a vaccinated person, should feel absolutely safe, that you’re going to be okay. That’s the thing. Whether or not what’s surrounding you is going to dictate you wearing a mask, you should feel that you are going to be safe from getting infected. 

Afton: 
My last question is, what was the first thing you did after you got vaccinated? 

Dr. Fauci: 
The first thing I did after I was fully vaccinated was to get our friends and neighbors—who we like very much and who, because we wanted to be outdoors in order to decrease the risk of infection before we were vaccinated—to finally, since the weather was so cool at the time, to sit down with friends and a meal without a mask, since everybody in the room was vaccinated. 

But before everybody got vaccinated, we did it outside. And boy, was it cold out there. 

Afton: 
Well, that sounds wonderful. Thank you so much for answering my questions. 

Dr. Fauci: 
It’s my pleasure. It’s good to have been with you. Take care of yourself, now.

242,242,Return of the Rabbits,"{'Movies and Television', 'Time Off'}","
Everyone’s favorite bunny-in-blue is back! Peter Rabbit and his squad—cousin Benjamin and sisters Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cottontail—star in Peter Rabbit 2: The Runaway. In the new movie, Peter travels far from home, in search of a place where he and his troublemaker tendencies fit in. But when his family comes looking for him, Peter has a big decision to make.
Rose Byrne plays Bea, a kind-hearted woman who cares for the rabbits. As a young girl growing up in Australia, Byrne enjoyed reading Beatrix Potter’s Peter Rabbit book series. “I loved rabbits,” she told TIME for Kids. “I collected ceramic rabbits, and I had three or four pet rabbits throughout my childhood. I was really a proper fangirl.”
Byrne says the new movie has more “action and adventure and plot twists and turns” than the first. “But it’s got the same mischievous humor and charm—it wouldn’t be Peter Rabbit if it didn’t.”
Peter Rabbit 2: The Runaway hops into theaters on June 11.

243,243,Reflecting on Racism,"{'Culture', 'United States'}","
In June 2020, Sesame Workshop began a study of how kids and families in the United States feel and talk about racism. Researchers questioned 147 families with children from ages 6 to 11. In January 2021, they checked in with the families again to see how their perspectives had changed.
The study, Coming Together: Family Reflections on Racism, will be released today. Sesame Workshop shared the results with TIME for Kids first. They show that most kids think people of different races are not treated fairly in the U.S. Many kids have witnessed an act of racism. And nearly half say they’ve experienced discrimination themselves. 
“Racism has always been in our society,” Sesame Workshop’s Tanya Haider told TFK Kid Reporter Sophia Hou on June 3. Haider is Sesame’s chief strategy officer and executive vice president of research and ventures. “We know it. We acknowledge it,” she says. “But what happened last summer—and the protests that followed—really has brought it to attention.”
On May 25, a man named George Floyd was killed by a police officer during an arrest in Minneapolis, Minnesota. A bystander captured the event on her phone and shared the video on social media. It sparked anti-racism protests around the world. “The increased media coverage around what happened with George Floyd was causing kids to ask questions that they hadn't before—of their parents, of their teachers, of each other,” Haider says. 
In January 2021, when young survey participants were asked about the protests, there were fewer who felt sad or angry than in June 2020. And more kids felt hopeful. “I feel like the protests helped with making changes to racism,” wrote one. “The future [feels] kind of promising,” wrote another.
Haider didn’t expect that 86% of kids surveyed would say that people in the U.S. aren’t treated fairly because of their race. “I was surprised it was that high,” she says. “That means nearly every kid, almost 9 out of 10, thought that people are treated unfairly on the basis of their skin.”
But Haider sees a reason to be hopeful. “The good thing about that number is that kids are aware that people are treated unfairly,” she says. “And perhaps they’ll do something about it.”

244,244,Should Summer Reading Be Mandatory?,"{'Debate', 'Opinion'}","
Reading is fun! But should it be required? Many kids are assigned books to read over the summer. Some people say summer reading keeps kids’ minds sharp. Others say kids need a break. Here, TIME for Kids readers weigh in.
Yes
You’re on break, but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t learn. Books can teach you anything and everything. You can learn new words or get inspired to create your own book! —Alexandra Kotsinis, 10, Westfield, New Jersey
Summer vacation is usually three months long, which means there is a long learning gap before the next school year. This time can be used to read and prevent learning loss. —Simran Adnani, 7, Troy, Michigan
Summer reading can help you prepare for the next school year. You’ll be able to develop a better vocabulary and express your opinions clearly. During the summer, you have a lot of time, so why not read? You might end up finding a book or series you enjoy! —Ahaana Sabari Rajan, 9, Gaithersburg, Maryland
Yes, summer reading should be mandatory. It’s something fun that can replace screen time. —Kauther Haque, 10, Milton, Ontario, Canada
No
If summer reading became mandatory, kids would only read because they were forced to. Forcing kids to read during the summer would definitely not help them form a lifelong love of reading. —Mikayla Ariyaratne, 9, Thousand Oaks, California
If summer reading is not mandatory, more kids will spend their time playing outside, which is a very healthy lifestyle to develop. —Aahil Bhagyaraj, 10, Chattanooga, Tennessee
We already have nine months of reading in school. Why do we have to read during our three months of freedom? —Ansley MacLeod, 11, Denver, Colorado
Summertime is a time for kids to relax, go outside, and enjoy just being a kid. —Pallavi Shah, 11, Scotch Plains, New Jersey
Kids have activities planned for the summer, such as sleepaway camp and day camp, so they won’t have time for extra reading. —Naftali Bochner, 10, Bronx, New York

245,245,My Cool Job: Roller Coaster Engineer,"{'Business', 'Engineering'}","
Larry Chickola is the vice president and chief corporate engineer of Six Flags theme parks. He spoke to TFK’s Rebecca Mordechai about his job.

I’ve always loved theme parks. Growing up, I would visit Cedar Point amusement park, in Sandusky, Ohio. That’s where I first rode the Corkscrew roller coaster. It was awesome. 
I dreamed of becoming an engineer, and studied mechanical engineering in college. It didn’t occur to me that I could design roller coasters for a living. Then a friend told me about a job at Six Flags: roller-coaster engineer. I jumped at the opportunity. 
As chief engineer, I oversee the design and construction of rides at Six Flags parks all over the world. In North America alone, there are more than 1,000 rides in these parks, including 157 roller coasters.

Right now, our engineers are designing the tallest, fastest, and longest roller coaster that has ever been built. It’s called Falcon’s Flight. It’ll be the main attraction at Six Flags in Saudi Arabia, which will open in 2023.
My job involves creativity and problem-solving. For instance, I wanted to make roller coasters accessible to people with disabilities. So I worked with engineers to install a system that would make the rides inclusive.

I often walk around the Six Flags Great Adventure park in Jackson Township, New Jersey. That’s where my office is. I like to observe visitors and figure out what makes a ride fun for them. That’s a different question from how fast or how tall I can make a ride go. If I want a ride to be tall, I can make it tall. But if I want it to be fun, how can I do that? Finding that answer is the hardest part of my job. 
There are some roller coasters that I’m very proud to have made. One is the Iron Rattler, in San Antonio, Texas. 


The Rattler is surrounded by a quarry. You get a look at these beautiful rock walls as the coaster goes up, and then you drop almost straight down. I’m happy that my rides can bring thrills like these to Six Flags visitors every day.

246,246,The Meaning of Memorial Day,"{'United States', 'History'}","
This story was originally published on May 25, 2018. It was updated on May 25, 2021.
Technically, summer doesn’t start until June 20. But many people consider Memorial Day to be the unofficial start of the season. This year, we celebrate the holiday on May 31. Many families will heat up the grill or head to the beach. But Memorial Day has the word memorial in it for a reason.
The national holiday got started on May 30, 1868. Union general John A. Logan declared the day an occasion to decorate the graves of Civil War soldiers. He called it Decoration Day. After World War I, the holiday was more commonly called Memorial Day. 
In 1950, President Harry S. Truman issued a proclamation that broadened the purpose of Memorial Day. He called on Americans to also observe the holiday as a day of prayer for peace. President Richard M. Nixon declared Memorial Day a federal holiday in 1971. 
Memorial Day is now observed on the last Monday of May. It honors the members of the U.S. military who died in American wars. One of the biggest Memorial Day traditions is for the president or vice president to give a speech. Another is for the president or vice president to lay a wreath on soldiers’ graves in the largest U.S. military burial ground, Arlington National Cemetery, in Virginia. 
Most towns have local Memorial Day celebrations. Here are some ways you can honor those who have served our country.
- Put flags or flowers on the graves of people who served in wars.
- Fly the U.S. flag at half-mast until noon.
- Visit monuments dedicated to soldiers, sailors, and marines.
- Participate in the National Moment of Remembrance at 3 p.m. local time.
- March in a parade.

247,247,Summer Snacking,"{'Food and Nutrition', 'Health'}","
Eating a piece of fruit or a Popsicle is easy, yummy, and refreshing in the summer. But will it give you enough fuel for outdoor play? Here are some ideas from cookbook author and cooking instructor Katie Kimball to keep you energized.
1. Make a system. A healthy snack routine turns frowns upside down. Talk to your family about the best snacking schedule. Then you won’t be wondering when your next snack is, and you won’t drive your parents nuts asking!
2. Watch for added sugar. You want lots of good energy so you can play outside. Check the ingredients. If sugar or high-fructose corn syrup is listed first or second, that’s a sweet treat for a special occasion—not an everyday snack.
3. Think: “satisfying.” A snack should take the edge off your hunger, not make you full. Choose snacks that will satisfy you without ruining your appetite for the next meal.
4. Say yes to protein and fat. Fat and protein take a long time to digest, so they’ll give you energy for a whole afternoon. Try a cheese stick with grapes, or nut or seed butter with an apple or toast. 
5. Try new recipes. Learning to cook is a fun summer activity that increases your creativity and helps you gain life skills. Scroll down to discover my homemade ranch recipe. Kids in my cooking class call it “amazing.” I hope you’ll try it!
Mrs. Kimball's Ranch Dip
Ingredients
1 cup of sour cream, plain yogurt, or mayo ½ teaspoon of dried parsley¼ teaspoon of dried dill weed¼ teaspoon of dried chives½ teaspoon of onion powder¼ teaspoon of garlic powder¼ teaspoon of salt 1 teaspoon to 1 tablespoon of red wine vinegar  milk (optional)
 Instructions
Choose the base (sour cream, plain yogurt, or mayo) or mix more than one together.Measure the base into a glass jar with a lid.Measure all the dry ingredients into the jar. If you don’t have one of the dried herbs, just use more of another green herb. If you don’t have the onion or garlic, you can use more of the other.Measure 1 teaspoon of vinegar into the jar.Mix the ingredients together well, with a long spoon, until everything is uniform, or looks the same.Taste the dip on a veggie stick. If you’d like it more tangy, add 1 or 2 more teaspoons of vinegar.To make a pourable dressing, add milk a little at a time until you like the texture.Store in the refrigerator and serve with raw veggies or salad.
Note: The flavor will get a little stronger after a few hours as the herbs soak into the sour cream or other base. You can always add a bit more herbs if you’d like more flavor.

248,248,Toys for the Summer,"{'Culture', 'Time Off'}","
There are so many ways to have fun and stay cool during the summer months. Here are some of our favorite outdoor toys and games.
Colorful Creations 

Sidewalk chalk is a classic tool for creative expression. You can draw pictures on surfaces such as cement and asphalt. You can also create a hopscotch court or leave friendly messages for neighbors. A company called Twee makes chalk in nontraditional shapes. In one set, Carrie's Castle, the chalk comes in geometric shapes that can be used to build castles. The Mason's Planets set contains nine chalk balls. The largest of these ""planets"" consist of three layers of color, so they change as you draw. (Mason's Planets Sidewalk Chalk: $42; Carrie's Castle Sidewalk Chalk: $36)
A Soapy Surprise

A lot of science goes into making soap bubbles. But the results—delicate spheres floating by on the breeze—feel like magic. Plus, they're so much fun to pop! Younger kids will love chasing down a cloud of bubbles. Older kids: Try to see how big of a bubble you can make. Budding scientists might even try to stir up the perfect homemade bubble solution. Just mix water, dish soap, and a pinch or two of sugar. For enough bubbles to last you the whole summer, we like Gazillion Bubbles' two-liter solution bottle, by Funrise. It comes with a specially designed seven-in-one bubble wand, perfect for blowing bubbles of all sizes. ($11)
Fun at Night

There's plenty of summer fun to be had after the sun goes down. Use glow sticks to light up outdoor games, such as soccer or basketball. Or stay active with a game of glow-in-the-dark Capture the Flag redux, by Starlux Games. The goal is for your team to capture your competitors' ""flag""—a glowing orb—before they capture yours. Keep an eye on their movements by following the glow-in-the-dark bracelets. But look out: They can see you too! Indoors or outside, the game is a great way to fill the warm twilight hours. ($50)
A New Challenge

Need a break from slides and swings? Try an obstacle course. It's a great way to keep your body moving. Plus, it improves your focus and resilience. It's okay if you fall. You can always get up and try again! Take a crack at obstacle course fun with B4 Adventure's Slackers NinjaLine 36-Foot Intro Kit. It comes with webbing that can be attached between two strong trees or posts. It also comes with hanging obstacles including gymnastic rings, monkey-bar holds, and nylon ropes. As your skills improve, you can increase the challenge by moving the obstacles farther apart. ($100) 
Fill 'Em Up

Playing games and doing activities with water balloons are great ways to spend time outdoors this summer—and to beat the heat! But filling and tying hundreds of water balloons is a time-consuming chore. Zuru's Bunch O Balloons changes that. It makes preparing water balloons fast and easy. Bunch O Balloons attaches to your hose. In 60 seconds, and all at once, it fills and ties 100 multicolored balloons. Play catch until they've all gone splat on the ground. ($8)
Stay Cool

Sprinklers aren't just for watering the lawn. They're also great for helping kids stay cool and have fun during the summer. Sprinklers add a fresh twist to games like freeze tag or Simon says, too. You can even create an obstacle course around a sprinkler. This rainbow Gigantic Outdoor Water Sprinkler, from PoolCandy, sprays water in all directions and features a jumbo archway that you and your friends can run through—a great finish line for a footrace. It's a refreshing addition to any active outdoor game. ($50) 
Slide into Summer

Nothing says summer like a Slip 'N Slide. The classic toy was invented in 1960 by Robert Carrier. Carrier came home from work one hot summer day to find his son and some friends sliding down the painted concrete driveway on a stream of water they created using the garden hose. Carrier had the idea to use a strip of plastic to create a safer surface. His idea was patented in 1961. Later that year, the toy company Wham-O began manufacturing the Slip 'N Slide. It was an instant hit. Today, Wham-O makes many different Slip 'N Slides, including the Slip 'N Slide Wave Rider Double. It's an extra-wide version that lets two riders slide at the same time. ($40)

249,249,CDC Director Talks with TIME for Kids,"{'People', 'Health'}","
Spring is here, and summer is on the way. But the COVID-19 pandemic isn’t over yet. What can we do to get our lives back? When can we finally relax and take our masks off?
Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky has some answers. She’s the director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Dr. Walensky leads the agency’s 21,000 employees, who work to protect Americans’ health and safety. Before moving to CDC headquarters, in Georgia, Dr. Walensky worked at Massachusetts General Hospital and taught at Harvard Medical School. She has spent her life working to understand and battle diseases. 

Recently, the CDC announced that kids ages 12 to 15 can get the COVID-19 vaccine. It also announced that fully vaccinated people no longer need to wear masks in most situations. I had an opportunity to talk with Dr. Walensky about these important developments, and to ask her questions from TFK Kid Reporters. 
I learned that vaccinating kids and adults will move us closer to life as we knew it. This is the first time I’ve ever been excited to get a shot!

TFK Kid Reporter Jeremy Liew:
This has been a really busy week for you. I'm excited to speak with you. 
The CDC just surprised us by announcing that people who are fully vaccinated don’t have to wear masks most of the time. Does that mean that if you’re fully vaccinated, life can go back to normal?
Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky:
I think we should first define what fully vaccinated is, so everybody understands. For kids 12 to 18, fully vaccinated means that you got two doses of the Pfizer vaccine, and then you waited two weeks to make sure you were completely through getting your whole immune response. 
We have now said that [fully vaccinated] individuals are safe and can take their mask off. I think it’s going to take some time for us to get back to what we call “normal.” And I think we’re probably going to get back to perhaps even a new, better, safer normal. But I do think that this means that we are taking another giant step to getting back to the lives we once knew. 
Jeremy:
What happens if someone who isn’t fully vaccinated doesn’t wear a mask? 
Dr. Walensky:
It’s really important to understand that the guidance we put out is about people who are fully vaccinated, and that they are protected. People who are not fully vaccinated continue to not be protected. So guidance for them would be, one, go get vaccinated; two, wear your mask until you’re fully vaccinated. And if you decide not to get fully vaccinated, continue to wear your mask and practice all of the strategies—distancing, masking, handwashing—that we have been recommending for months now.
Jeremy:
You also recently announced that kids age 12 to 15 are able to get the COVID vaccine. I just turned 13, and a lot of my friends are eager to get it. Can you tell us more about that decision? 
Dr. Walensky:
We have known that the Pfizer vaccine, when it was first authorized, went down to kids ages 16 and up. What they generally do in studies is first, they test them in the adult ages. And then they do different kinds of studies to make sure that they are also safe in kids, and that [kids] are getting the same immune response. 
So we looked at the data, with the Food and Drug Administration [FDA], in over 2,200 kids. And they showed that the vaccine was safe and 100% protective. There were 16 cases of COVID in the kids who didn’t get a vaccine, and none in the kids who did get the vaccine. And in that context, what generally happens is the [FDA] goes first. They authorize the vaccine for this age range. And then the CDC comes in with their Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, and we approve that authorization.
Jeremy:
A lot of kids have questions. The other TIME for Kids Kid Reporters shared some with me. Rory from California wants to know: “What impact do you think expanding the vaccine eligibility to 12- to 15-year-olds will have on the pandemic? And how soon will we see that impact?” 
Dr. Walensky:
I hope it will have a big impact. I hope teens and tweens will be eager to get the vaccine. I have a 16-year-old. I knew he was particularly eager to get the vaccine because he was then able to go back to seeing his friends again, to go out again, to feel safer going out again.
There are about 17 million kids [in the U.S.] between the ages of 12 to 15. And they are now all eligible to get the Pfizer vaccine. 
Jeremy:
What if your parents don’t really want you to get vaccinated? 
Dr. Walensky:
That’s certainly going to be a family discussion. What I would encourage teens and parents to do is to get more information. Talk to trusted advisers in your community: your pharmacist, your pediatrician, local health departments, your clergy. Go and talk to them about the benefits and risks of potential vaccination.
Jeremy:
Here’s a question from Pranav from New York: “Do the current vaccines effectively protect kids from new and emerging variants of the coronavirus?” 
Dr. Walensky:
Great question. We are watching these emerging variants very, very carefully. The data out there now demonstrate that all of our vaccines work to prevent against all the variants that we have here in the United States. And we have no reason to suspect that would be different for kids [than for] for adults.
Jeremy:
Many of the TFK Kid Reporters want to know about schools. Here’s a two-part question. Sophia from New Jersey asks: “How will schools handle some students being vaccinated and some not?” And Victoria from Pennsylvania asks: “Do you think that eventually, students will be required to get the COVID-19 vaccine?”
Dr. Walensky:
Both of those are really important questions. Just as we’ve released guidance for what you can do if you’re vaccinated, we now have to revise our guidance for how schools are going to handle kids who are vaccinated and [kids] who are not. There are going to be [schools with students] ranging [from] before the age of 12 [to] above the age of 12. And then there are going to be schools that are entirely eligible.
We don’t have any vision right now that we, as a part of a federal government, will require vaccination. Each city and county will make those decisions. I also want to emphasize that we are not one uniform country in terms of how we are doing in a pandemic. Areas in the country have higher rates of vaccination. Other areas have lower rates of vaccination. Similarly, some areas have high rates of disease and low rates of disease. So as schools are making those individual decisions, they’re going to have to look at how their county or city is doing.
Jeremy:
Talking about schools, here’s another question. Bellen in Virginia asks: “Were there changes introduced in schools during the pandemic that you recommend keeping? What are some examples?”
Dr. Walensky:
As part of our guidance for opening schools, we’ve done a lot of work with the schools. We had distancing, masking, cleaning, ensuring hand sanitizers were around, and ensuring that people who had symptoms had access to testing. And we want to make sure that there’s good ventilation in those schools. 
Many of these things remain important. If students have symptoms, they should be out of school and go get a test. We should keep cleaning surfaces in the school because surfaces, in general, should be clean. Kids should keep their hands clean. They should hand-sanitize. That’s not just good for COVID, but for all respiratory viruses. One of the things that we might be able to relax is, if you’re vaccinated, you might not need to wear a mask. And you probably don’t need to—well, you definitely don’t need to distance if you’re vaccinated. So some of those things are going to be able to be relaxed, depending on the age of [students in] the classroom. And some of them we’ll have to maintain.
Jeremy:
Afton from Arizona wants to know: “If I get the vaccine, I’ll be vaccinated this summer. But my three younger sisters won’t. What can I do to help keep them safe?” 
Dr. Walensky:
There are so many families who are going to face this challenge, where they have one student who’s vaccinated and younger siblings who are not. That vaccinated student is safe to be out of the house without a mask. But . . . he or she is going to have to promote the safe mitigation strategies that we have been promoting for the last many months to make sure his or her siblings are safe. So continuing to mask, continuing to distance, not being in crowded places until those younger children are eligible for vaccination. 
Jeremy:
Abby from Hawaii and Miguel from Texas are both 11. They want to know when they’ll be able to get the vaccine. 
Dr. Walensky:
We’re waiting for data from the FDA. We started first with the 16-year-olds. Then we went down to 12. I think the next bracket is going to be down to 9, and then down to 6. We’re really hoping that we’ll see some of those data in the fall and that we’ll be able to get that age range vaccinated soon. 
Jeremy:
Bellen from Virginia has another question for you. She asks: “COVID-19 has been a disproportionate burden on some groups. Can you talk about how you are connecting with and serving people from these diverse communities?” 
Dr. Walensky:
This is such an important question and one that we at the CDC are really focused on. Before I came to the CDC, I was a doctor in a hospital in Massachusetts. We saw how Hispanic communities, Black and brown communities, were hit hard by this pandemic. They had higher death rates. They had higher rates of hospitalization. What we need to do now is make sure that they have adequate resources [for] vaccination. We are doing an extraordinary amount of outreach. I’m really pleased to say that just this past week, we’ve put some more data on the CDC website that demonstrates that we’re making enormous strides in getting vaccination to the most vulnerable communities.

250,250,Educating the Country,"{'United States', 'Government'}","
Once a teacher, always a teacher!  
I met the secretary of education, Miguel Cardona, at the Department of Education, in Washington, D.C. I could instantly tell that he’s a true teacher at heart. 
Miguel Cardona was sworn in as the 12th secretary of education on March 2, 2021. As the head of the United States Department of Education, he advises the president and the federal government on policies, programs, and activities related to education in the United States. Before he started this job, he was the commissioner of education in Connecticut, his home state, and also a public school educator there. It would have been so cool to have been a student in his fourth-grade class.  
Secretary Cardona made me feel totally comfortable just being myself. I bet his vision is going to bring many great things to teachers and students. We talked outside, so we could stay safe and be socially distanced. After our interview, he took me to see his office—the view was amazing. He answered my questions and the questions below, from other TFK Kid Reporters from around the country. Talking with him was one of the most inspiring conversations I’ve ever had! 

Bellen Woodard:
This week is Teacher Appreciation Week. Is there anything you would like to say to teachers?
Miguel Cardona:
I want to say thank you, because teaching is a tough profession. It’s a very rewarding profession. But this past year—I won't say this lightly—I really feel like teachers saved lives, because they were there for their kids, whether it was in person or connecting with them when they were at home, going through some hardship. This year, more than any other year, we need to, as a country, stand up and applaud our teachers for what they’ve done.
Bellen:
What is being done to promote equity in the school building? This includes what resources children learn from, and the curriculum.
Cardona:
In our country, ever since I was your age, the inequities in education were pretty bold. They were pretty obvious. So throughout my career—I was a fourth-grade teacher, I was a school principal at an elementary school, and then I worked at the district and state levels—I really cared about making sure all students had opportunities to be successful. And now, as secretary of education, one of the things that I want to do is make sure that the American Rescue Plan, which the president and Congress pushed forward, goes toward those students who need it the most. Because I think that in order for us to close those gaps, where all students can achieve high, we have to provide more support to those students who have been underserved historically, and students who need a little bit more support. So I’m totally in favor of that.
TFK Kid Reporter Afton Campbell, age 12, Surprise, Arizona:  
How can students help welcome migrants into the educational system? 
Cardona: 
That’s a great question. We often talk about what the adults can do, but I think what the kids can do is kind of more important. Maybe welcome them by just smiling. It’s amazing what a smile can do for a student who’s new to a country, who maybe doesn’t know the language or the customs and the culture. A smile is a universal language. And also accepting them and bringing them in. If they’re playing kickball or something, let them play, even though they may not know the rules yet. You can teach them. But also be accepting of who they are. They might come with different food, they might have different customs or different dress. Accepting who they are and affirming them is a great way students can help.
TFK Kid Reporter Victoria Hanson, age 11, Chadds Ford Township, Pennsylvania: 
I am in the sixth grade, and I have noticed that my school curriculum and my older sister’s high school curriculum both lack diversity. I think this contributes to the racial issues we have in this country. What are your plans to ensure that all states adopt and implement diversity and inclusion into their school curriculums?
Cardona: 
That’s a great question. When I was commissioner of schools in Connecticut, we passed the requirement that all districts had to teach Black and Latino studies. We did that because we felt that the curriculum didn’t really reflect the beautiful diversity in our schools. I know students are more engaged in school when they see people that look like them in their stories, or they get to learn about other cultures. I think that’s important, not only for students of color, but for all students—to see diversity in their books. We want to encourage states to make sure that they’re looking at the curriculum and listening to students. If we listen to students regularly, we’ll hear about other ways we can improve our system.
TFK Kid Reporter Rory Hu, age 11, Cupertino, California:
The number of girls who pursue a STEM-based career is dramatically lower than the number of boys. What would you do to encourage more girls to look into STEM?
Cardona:
That’s a great question too. Reduce the stigma, [the idea] that it’s only a boys’ field. That’s absolutely not true. There are so many STEM opportunities for all students, including girls, and we have to have programs that introduce them to those things. Bring in people who are working in the STEM fields to talk to students. And it would help if those people were females, to model that the STEM fields are for girls, too. 
TFK Kid Reporter Ian McKenna, age 16, Austin, Texas: 
Currently, the states have varying metrics and rankings to assess graduation rates and students' preparedness for college. In order to create a more equal educational playing field for all students, are there any thoughts of creating national standards for excellence, both within states and across the country? 
Cardona:
Another great question. It’s interesting, because most states prefer to have some autonomy around some of those decisions. And actually, our system is set up so that states are responsible for education. [The federal government] provides a supportive role, we provide some funding, and we protect the rights of students. But in terms of curriculum and standards, those are mostly state-based decisions. We do encourage high standards, and where possible, we try to encourage consistent practices so that there are not different standards in different states. 
TFK Kid Reporter Jeremy Liew, age 13, Riverside, Connecticut:
What Meriden [Connecticut] Public Schools teacher inspired you?
Cardona:
Riverside’s not too far from where I live, where I raised my family. When I was in second grade, I had an art teacher, Mr. O’Neil. I remember being in his class, doing a picture about football—I love football. I remember looking up and it hit me then that he was my first male teacher. He was my first African-American teacher. And he was my first teacher that introduced a topic that I really loved—football. So I always admired him. To this day, I know Mr. O’Neil. And when I got to high school, there was a teacher named Mrs. Ransom, an art teacher also, who really inspired me to become a teacher. So those are two teachers who really influenced me.
TFK Kid Reporter Sophia Hou, age 11, Short Hills, New Jersey:  
In the fall, if parents are vaccinated but young students are not, will students be required to go in person? And now that schools are prepared to go remote, will schools have snow days anymore?
Cardona:
Before I have a statement on the snow day thing, what do you think? Should we have snow days?
Bellen:
Yes. Because in a normal year, you wouldn’t have to go online.
Cardona:
Now let me ask you this: If your summer could start three days earlier, would you prefer to have snow days or just to do online school, so you could get out a little bit early?
Bellen:
I would probably prefer to have snow days.
Cardona:
There’s something about snow days, right? To know that you don’t have to get up and you can stay in bed a little longer. Yeah, I hear you. 
So the [other] question is: If parents are vaccinated, should I require students [to go to school in person]? I’ll be honest with you, I know education and I know students, but I’m not a medical expert. So I would leave that to the medical experts to determine whether or not it should be required. 
With regard to snow days, I remember talking to someone from Connecticut maybe three weeks ago, and they told me that they’re debating this very issue. But your perspective, as a fifth grader, would be to just keep the snow days, we’ll take on the [extra] days at the end of the school year. Good to know that. I’ll let them know.
TFK Kid Reporter Abby Rogers, age 11, Lahaina, Hawaii: 
What is the Department of Education going to do to catch up all the students in public school who have lost a year of education compared to the students who have been going in person to private school the whole year?
Cardona:
That issue, Bellen, keeps me up at night. I want to make sure that when we go back to school, we’re relentless about making sure that all students have an opportunity to catch up not only academically but emotionally, too. Those students have been behind a computer for a year. They need to be around their friends. They need to be playing. So when we get back to school, it’s not just about making sure that they’re getting double the work. They have to have double the time to be with their friends and engaging in those things that make school fun. 
TFK Kid Reporter Pranav Mukhi, age 11, South Setauket, New York: 
In your nomination speech, you mentioned that you were hoping to forge opportunities out of the COVID crisis. Could you tell us about what opportunities you were hoping to forge?
Cardona:
That’s a great way to end the interview. The crisis really made life tough for all of us. We have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to come back stronger than we ever were before. And what I mean by that is, we have the opportunity to make sure all children—regardless of skin color, where they live, whether they have money or they don’t have money—have opportunities to go to college and achieve their dreams. We have opportunities to reimagine what school looks like and to allow students like you to have a greater voice in the learning that happens and in the curriculum. We have opportunities to reach students that we haven’t been able to reach before. There are so many opportunities to not only help our school system but lift our nation.

251,251,Educators Who Inspire,"{'People', 'Community'}","
Everyone knows teachers who go above and beyond to help their students learn and grow. This year, Teacher Appreciation Week starts May 3. To celebrate, we asked TFK Kid Reporters to tell us about a teacher who inspires them. Read what they had to say. Then think about a teacher you appreciate. How will you celebrate them this Teacher Appreciation Week?

TFK Kid Reporter Victoria Hanson: Math is the hardest subject for me. Even though I have to study extra hard for her class, my favorite teacher is Mrs. Manolescu, my math teacher. I truly appreciate her because she is really good at explaining how to solve problems. Also, I am an online learner this year, and she always gives the online students equal attention. When I fell behind, Mrs. Manolescu reached out to my other teachers and helped me figure out which assignments I needed to submit. I want her to know that I am appreciative of all that she has done for me this year.
TFK Kid Reporter Afton Campbell: My fifth-grade teachers Mrs. Smith and Mrs. Haven (who also taught me in fourth grade) always made me feel like I could do anything! Mrs. Smith made history come alive. She dressed as famous characters like Leif Erikson and Queen Anne. Mrs. Haven empowered my classmates and me by letting us experiment with science. I especially loved making circuits with my friends. It was such a fun experience! I am thankful for both of them for supporting me and building a foundation of learning that will last a lifetime. Happy Teacher Appreciation Week!
TFK Kid Reporter Rory Hu: Let’s face it: A chair as the barre, slippery socks instead of ballet shoes, and everyone crammed onto one computer screen is not an ideal environment for ballet class. Teaching ballet over Zoom is extremely challenging. But my teacher, Ms. Hammar, not only made virtual ballet class work, she made it enjoyable and engaging. She has a magical charm that brings the spirit of dance through the screen into our rooms. Ballet is finally exciting for me. Ms. Hammar observes everyone carefully during practices to find what we need to improve on and gives personal feedback. She offers tailor-made tips so each of us can grow in our own way. Her teaching improved my moves and made my dance a lot more graceful. What sets Ms. Hammar apart is her passion to help her students improve. She is always patient with questions and takes care to answer them thoroughly. When you ask about a move, she will first demonstrate, then have you do it, and she’ll continue to give instructions until you are perfect. She does not brush off any questions, no matter how trivial they are. Thanks to Ms. Hammar, I am one graceful jeté closer to being a true ballerina.
TFK Kid Reporter Pranav Mukhi: Mrs. Toner, I appreciate your coming to school every day to teach our class at Nassakeag Elementary. Coming to school and playing basketball and soccer with all my friends during recess makes me feel very happy during these difficult pandemic times. Thanks for making math and social studies so fun and interactive for me!
Mrs. Amoroso, thank you for all the patience you have had with students this year. I know that giving instructions to tune a cello remotely is no easy task. I really loved working with you while preparing for the New York State School Music Association festival!
Sethu Sir, thank you for the awesome tabla instructions, both in person and remote. I enjoy it so much, and I hope it gives you joy as well to see your students learn and enjoy playing the tabla.

TFK Kid Reporter Abby Rogers: Did you know that when you cut down a tree, it releases all of the carbon dioxide it has stored? This is just one of the many environmental facts Mrs. Nunez taught us this year. We have explored critical topics ranging from overfishing to deforestation to coral bleaching and so much more. By providing us with the opportunity to learn about these important issues, she has educated us and made us aware of the consequences of our actions. Thank you, Mrs. Nunez, for turning me and my classmates into globally minded citizens.
TFK Kid Reporter Sophia Hou: One of the teachers I admire is my fifth-grade newspaper club teacher, Mrs. Jones. She is very encouraging to all her students, no matter what. Mrs. Jones is always available to help us when we need it. She responds to emails almost instantly. She is very passionate about her work and what she teaches, and although I do not have her as a teacher anymore, she still keeps in touch with me. Mrs. Jones is the person who inspired me to become a TFK Kid Reporter, too!
TFK Kid Reporter Ian McKenna: Having a learning disability has made English, especially writing, a real struggle for me. I’ve dreaded English class for as long as I can remember. This year, however, I was lucky enough to have Mrs. Swan. She’s helped me tremendously. Not only has she helped me improve my essay-writing process, textual analysis, and overall essay quality, but she has helped me gain confidence I never knew I had. Outside of class, she has been working with me to improve my organizational and time-management skills. And she even offered to write college recommendation letters for me. She has had the biggest impact on me throughout my high school career. I’m so grateful to have had Mrs. Swan for English literature and composition this year!
TFK Kid Reporter Jeremy Liew: For the past three years, I’ve always thought of Ms. Craig, my elementary school math teacher, during Teacher Appreciation Week. Even though I'm now in middle school algebra, I still use her study skills: Read the textbook for tips, review old homework I missed, and ask the teacher for help. Regardless of my test scores, she always pushed me to be my best self, even if it meant wearing glasses for the first time. She emphasized understanding the material so that I could apply it elsewhere and teach my classmates. When I was in Ms. Craig's class, I always felt confident to speak up (even with glasses)—maybe because she also liked my funny jokes and magic tricks!

252,252,Calling for Change,"{'Culture', 'United States'}","
On March 28, Mina Fedor, 12, led a rally with her friends Bee, Anna, Juno, and Mila. It took place in Berkeley, California. More than 1,200 people joined them. The girls led a crowd onto a bridge across a freeway. They posted signs that spelled “♥ Our Asian Community.” 
“We were grateful that so many people showed up,” Mina told TIME for Kids.  

Mina and her friends are troubled by recent attacks against Asian Americans. Violence and discrimination against Asian Americans have risen since the pandemic started, in early 2020. Elderly people are often targeted. 
Recent attacks against Asians are based on a false belief. This belief is that they are responsible for the coronavirus. The virus was first identified in China in late 2019. But no one person, group, or country is to blame for the coronavirus pandemic. 

Russell Jeung cofounded Stop AAPI Hate. (AAPI stands for “Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.”) The group started collecting reports of anti-Asian hate incidents last year. “We were immediately flooded with hundreds of them,” Jeung recalls. Since then, the group has received more than 3,795 reports. 
A Troubling History
Discrimination against Asians in the U.S. isn’t new. It began in the 1850s. That’s when Chinese immigrants arrived. They were seen as a threat to white workers’ jobs. In 1882, Congress passed the Chinese Exclusion Act. It banned most Chinese immigration. Bans continued until the 1940s. They told Asians they were not wanted, Ellen Wu says. She’s a professor at Indiana University. “Sometimes, Americans told Asians they were unwelcome through violence,” Wu told TIME for Kids. “Ultimately, they expressed it in the law.”
Chinese people fought the Exclusion Act in court. Asian Americans still advocate for themselves today. “They have pushed back and stood up” for respectful treatment, Wu says.
But many people are unaware that Asians experience racism. They believe that Asians are more successful than other minority groups. In fact, Asians are unfairly held up as an example to other groups (see “The Model Minority ”).
All of Us Together

Jessica Owyoung is a cofounder of Compassion in Oakland,  in California. The group pairs Asian-American elders with volunteers. The volunteers walk with them around town. “Elders feel alone and scared,” Owyoung says. The way to make them feel safer, she says, “is to physically be there for them.”

President Joe Biden has announced anti-racism actions. These are to benefit Asian Americans. “Hate can have no safe harbor in America,” he says.
For Mina and her friends, showing you care can go a long way. “It’s important to be an ,” her friend Mila says. “We’re all doing our part to help the cause.”	
The Model Minority Myth

The model minority myth is a widespread idea that Asians work harder and value education more than other minority groups do. This idea is harmful. It leads to the false belief that Asians do not face racism and discrimination.
The myth also creates false beliefs about other groups. “Working hard and valuing education and family—these are values common to all communities,” Wu says.

253,253,A COVID Milestone,"{'Government', 'Health'}","
On April 18, the United States reached a milestone. About 130 million adults had gotten at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. That’s half of all the adults in the country. This data comes from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Of the 130 million, 84 million people are fully vaccinated. Some got two shots of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine. Others got one shot of Johnson & Johnson. At this rate, the U.S. could vaccinate 70% of its population by mid-June. That might be enough to control the virus.
There’s still work to be done. A recent Associated Press-NORC poll found that 25% of U.S. adults are unwilling to get vaccinated. But the number of willing people has been rising. More are becoming eligible, too. Anyone 16 or older can get a vaccine.
“We’re making tremendous progress,” President Joe Biden said on April 18. “But we’re still in [a] race against this virus, and we need to vaccinate tens of millions more Americans.”

254,254,Counting T. Rexes,"{'Science', 'History'}","
More than 2 billion Tyrannosaurus rexes walked the Earth. That’s according to a new study published in the journal Science.
The reptiles were not all alive at the same time. They were around for about 1 million to 4 million years, about 70 million years ago. There may have been about 20,000 adult T. rexes at any one time. 
Only about a hundred T. rex fossils have been found. Researchers arrived at the number 2 billion by looking at key facts about T. rex, including its average body size and energy needs.

On April 19, NASA’s helicopter Ingenuity (shown in flight in a series of images) took off on Mars. This was the first powered flight by an aircraft on a planet other than Earth. The four-pound helicopter spent 39 seconds in the air and reached an altitude of 10 feet. It carried wing fabric from the 1903 Wright Flyer, the world’s first successful powered plane. Helicopters may one day carry packages and act as lookouts for astronauts on other planets and moons.

256,256,Reimagining Cities,"{'Engineering', 'World'}","
Having everything you need close to home could make you healthier. It could even build stronger bonds between you and your neighbors. 
This is the idea behind the 15-minute city. It’s a place where people can get all the services they need within 15 minutes of home, on foot or by bike. This model is being developed in cities around the world. 
Carlos Moreno is a scientific director at IAE Paris Sorbonne Business School, in France. He’s also a key  behind the 15-minute-city plan for Paris. “My vision is a livable city that increases the quality of life,” Moreno told TIME for Kids. 
Healthier Living
Moreno’s vision was inspired by the need to fight climate change. In a 15-minute city, car travel is not a priority. The focus is on building more sidewalks and bike lanes. Moreno says walking or biking “is a good way to radically reduce carbon dioxide emissions.” 
Anne Hidalgo is Paris’s mayor. She plans to build 15-minute communities all over the city. That means removing 60,000 parking spaces by 2024. Bike lanes would run along every street. 
This design does more than benefit the planet. It promotes a healthier way of life. 
Joe Zehnder is chief planner for the city of Portland, Oregon. He’s developing “20-minute neighborhoods.” Having grocery stores close to home gives people better access to healthy foods, Zehnder says. That gives them “the ability to make healthier choices.” 
Welcome Home 
Zehnder has another important goal: to make neighborhoods . 
As a neighborhood becomes more convenient, housing costs can increase. This leaves a lot of people out. Zehnder’s plan is to “create more housing of more types.” That way, “households in different economic situations can live there,” he says.
Moreno supports this. He says the “new economic and social model” should be to create places that all people can call home.

257,257,A Guilty Verdict,"{'United States', 'People'}","
On April 20, a 12-person jury in Minneapolis, Minnesota, found former police officer Derek Chauvin guilty of the murder of George Floyd. Chauvin killed Floyd during an arrest in Minneapolis on May 25, 2020. A bystander captured the event on her phone and shared the video on social media. It sparked anti-racism protests around the world.
The jury made its decision after a three-week trial. People who took the stand included medical experts, police officers, and witnesses to Floyd’s death. The verdict could send Chauvin to prison for decades. The judge will determine his sentence in about eight weeks.
Floyd’s younger brother Philonise talked to the press about the verdict. He spoke about the history of violence against Black people in the United States. This time, he said, the violence was captured on camera for the world to see. He spoke again about the verdict the next day: “It makes us happier knowing that [George’s] life, it mattered, and he didn’t die in vain.”
President Joe Biden spoke after the verdict. He said Floyd’s death “ripped the blinders off for the whole world” to see systemic racism. But he added that more laws are needed to fight racism and violence. “We can’t stop here. In order to deliver real change and reform, we can and we must do more to reduce the likelihood that tragedies like this will ever happen and occur again.”

258,258,8 Questions for Mae Jemison,"{'Science', 'Space'}","
In 1992, Mae Jemison was the first Black woman astronaut to travel into space. In February, she published a new edition of Find Where the Wind Goes. It’s a book for young readers. She spoke with TFK Kid Reporter Bellen Woodard about her life and book.
1. What’s it like being in space?
One thing that is really interesting is being able to go around the Earth every 90 minutes and see this amazing planet. And I did a lot of work in space. I think people miss that astronauts do a lot of work, even if they’re not training for a mission.
2. What’s the most fun thing about being in space?
Being able to float. It’s such a silly feeling! 
3. What’s your book about?
It’s about how to  life and become the person you intend to be. [Life is] not about a job. It’s not what you study. It’s the kind of person you want to be inside. For me, that was always about exploration, creativity, and making a difference.
4. I noticed that you use wind in the title and as a common theme in your book. Why?
It comes and it goes, and it leads you along a path. There are different types of wind. Some are very soft and subtle—they’re a little breeze. Some are strong. Those are some of the ways I think of the events in my life.
5. On the book’s cover, you’re wearing one feather earring. Why?
When I arrived in New York City for medical school, I had a feather in my ear. I used to wear just one feather earring in college a lot. 
6. You’ve written that you love cats and feel they have superpowers. Can you explain?
When I was growing up, we always had pets. We had dogs and cats. We even had a rabbit. But what I loved about cats was how self-confident they were. Cats have these superpowers of being able to be self-confident, , and flexible.
7. I heard someone say that, instead of asking kids what they want to be when they grow up, adults should ask what they want to change. What do you think?
Let me say this: There were experiences I had growing up when I questioned the fairness of society. They helped me think about making sure people are included. That’s guided me in my work. The more people’s perspectives you have, the better the ideas that come through.
8. I want people to be included too. What do you want to say to kids who don’t feel included?
Be who you are. Use your talents and don’t shrink!

May is Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) Heritage Month. Here are three recent books with AAPI themes or characters. Which one would you like to read? 
The Last Fallen Star
In The Last Fallen Star, 12-year-old Korean-American Riley Oh wants to become a healing witch like her sister, Hattie. Hattie creates a spell so she can share her magic with Riley. But the spell goes wrong. To fix everything, Riley must find the last fallen star.Author Graci Kim told TIME for Kids that she hopes readers know it’s okay to feel like an outsider, as Riley does. “True acceptance and true belonging start within ourselves,” she says. —By Karena Phan 
Three Keys
Three Keys follows an 11-year-old girl named Mia Tang. Mia and her family have emigrated from China to the United States. Now, they own and operate a motel. As immigrants, the Tangs are forced to deal with prejudice. Kelly Yang wrote Three Keys. Her experiences as an Asian American inspired Mia’s character. Yang says representation in books is important. “Growing up, I never saw an Asian-American girl on the cover of a book,” she told TFK. “It’s really important for kids . . . to see that there isn’t just one American narrative.” —By Ellen Nam

260,260,Sweet Success,"{'United States', 'People'}","
North Duke Street in downtown Lancaster, Pennsylvania, smells like dessert. The scent comes from a shop that sells stroopies. These are cinnamon waffle-sandwich cookies with a caramel center. 
The cookies are also known as stroopwafels. Workers at the shop bake about 10,000 of them each week. Co-owner Jennie Groff is proud of her product. But the thing she’s most excited about, she told TIME for Kids, “is that we provide meaningful employment to refugee women who call Lancaster their new home.”

The Lancaster Stroopie Company has two main goals. One is to make delicious cookies. The other is to make a difference in the lives of refugee women and children. “It can be kind of lonely when you’re in a new place,” Groff says. “Even though the women are from different parts of the world, there’s just this community that’s developed at work, which is really beautiful.”
Coming to America
Refugees are people who have been forced to flee their country. This can be due to war or fear of . There are about 26 million refugees worldwide. About half are under 18.
Anne-Marie Gray is executive director of the group USA for UNHCR. It helps the United Nations refugee agency. “These are people that don’t choose to flee,” she says of refugees. “They have to flee, often for their lives or safety.”

Currently, the government allows up to 15,000 refugees to resettle and work in the U.S. President Joe Biden says he’d like to increase that number to 62,500 for this year. Refugees must apply for entry into the U.S. Applications are reviewed by the government. The screening process can last two years. If approved, a refugee might settle in Lancaster.
Danene Sorace is the city’s mayor (see “A Welcoming City”). She says moving to a new country can be tough. “What [Groff] is doing is providing a runway for families to be successful and thrive.”
New Friends and Neighbors
Mary Myint is from Myanmar. That’s a country in Asia. Myint felt unsafe as a Christian in Myanmar. She and her family resettled in Lancaster. That was in 2013. “I love Lancaster,” she says. But there were challenges. “The hardest part was that I couldn’t speak English,” she says. Myint also needed a job. She got one at the Lancaster Stroopie Company. It offers English classes. 

Today, Groff employs nine refugee women. They come from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Myanmar, Nepal, and Syria. “As they come and bring their gifts and talents, our lives are ,” she says.
A Welcoming City

 
 
Lancaster, Pennsylvania, has long been a welcoming place. “It’s just part of [our] DNA,” Jennie Groff says. In the 1700s, Amish and Mennonite people settled near Lancaster. They could freely practice their religion in the area. They’re still an important part of the community. 
 
In recent years, the city of Lancaster has welcomed legal immigrants and refugees. “We care about their success,” mayor Danene Sorace says. “Their success is our success.”

261,261,A Volcano Erupts,"{'World', 'Earth Science'}","
On April 9, a volcano called La Soufrière erupted on Saint Vincent. The island is in the Caribbean Sea. Thousands of people there were forced to leave their homes. The explosion was massive. It sent hot ash 32,000 feet into the sky. The volcano continued to erupt for days.  
""It's destroying everything in its path,"" says Erouscilla Joseph. She's director of the Seismic Research Centre at the University of the West Indies. Joseph says there could be more explosions to come. It's hard to know whether they'd be bigger or smaller than what the island has seen so far, she says.
Government-run shelters and empty cruise ships have taken on people who left their homes. Other people have fled to nearby islands to get out of harm's way. 
La Soufrière began showing signs of activity in December. Until then, it had been inactive for decades. It last erupted in 1979. Elford Lewis fled his home on April 11. He remembers the eruption of 1979. ""This one is more serious,"" he says.

When Caster Pettway, 67, was a girl, there were always quilts around. Sometimes, her mother would hang a quilt on the porch. This was to show it off to the neighbors. She always seemed to be sewing a new one. “And everybody in every house, they did the same thing,” Pettway told TIME for Kids. 
Pettway is from Gee’s Bend, in Alabama. Many residents are related to people who were enslaved on a cotton plantation in the 1800s.
Pettway grew up in the 1960s. Back then, Gee’s Bend was a  community of cotton farmers. Now, it’s seen as the birthplace of an important art form. 
A New Style 
Women in Gee’s Bend took up quilting sometime in the 1800s. At first, they made quilts to keep warm. But they didn’t have proper fabric. So they cut up old clothing and sacks. They sewed the scraps together. 
Traditional quilters use strict patterns. These women did not. They cut the fabric into large, irregular shapes. The results were bold and beautiful. The quilts were unlike any others in the world. 

 
In 1998, art collector William Arnett saw a photo of a Gee’s Bend quilt. He was impressed. Arnett visited the town and bought the quilt. In 2002, he arranged to display Gee’s Bend quilts in museums.  The quilts took the art world by storm. Experts compared them to work by Henri Matisse. He was a famous European painter. 
One critic called the quilts “some of the most miraculous works of modern art America has produced.”

Dear TFK,
I’ve noticed that you focus a lot on young activists in your articles, and I love it! They are all so inspiring. When I feel inspired, I want to go out and do something, make a change in my community, and be an activist. So I wonder, what does it take to be an activist? How do you start? Can I become one? Surely, some of your readers would like to know.
Carolina Mariel Caraballo, 11
Bronx, New York

Dear Carolina, 
Anyone can become an activist if there’s an issue they feel strongly about. I started speaking up about disabilities because I know what it’s like to have one and be treated differently because of it. 
When I was little, I noticed that toy figures didn’t look like me. At 10, I started a petition. I asked a toy company to offer -different options. I spoke about it on the news. After more than a year, I got to work with a design team on a Barbie doll. It uses a  leg. The experience showed me that the more I spoke up, the more changes I could make.
Being an activist may mean speaking up in a more public way than you usually would. Taking risks is a big part of being an activist. 
Your age doesn’t matter. Many kids are fighting for change. Mari Copeny, 13, is making sure our country has safe drinking water. Naomi Wadler was your age when she spoke at the March for Our Lives rally to stop gun violence. Haven Coleman and Taylor Richardson are both teenagers. Haven is raising awareness of the climate crisis. Taylor is making sure that girls of all races are included in STEAM education.
If you care about an issue, learn as much as you can about it. Find ways to speak up. Maybe it’s writing a letter to your local paper. Maybe it’s starting a club. You can work with other kids to unite your voices and make a change. 
You don’t have to do something as big as launching a new toy or speaking at a rally. If you help even one person learn and change, you’ve made a big difference. —By Jordan Reeves

Gray wolves have roamed North America for at least half a million years. Their habitat once included most of the  United States. But during the 1800s and early 1900s, wolves were hunted to near extinction. By the 1960s, the U.S. wolf population was limited to a handful of creatures.  
Then, in 1973, the Endangered Species Act (ESA) became law. It protects animals that are at risk of becoming extinct. Gray wolves were placed on the endangered-species list. Killing them was illegal. And the U.S. government worked to support wolf . A famous example of this effort began in 1995. Thirty-one wolves were moved from Canada to Yellowstone National Park. By 2015, more than 500 gray wolves were living in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. 

Today, the continental U.S. is home to more than 6,000 gray wolves. On January 4, 2021, the U.S. government removed gray wolves from the endangered-species list. Usually, an animal’s delisting would be cause for celebration. But some say the predators still need protection. 
A Difference of Opinion
“Wolves are controversial,” Adrian Treves told TIME for Kids. He’s a wolf expert at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. “People can’t agree about their protected status or whether they’re actually safe and secure.” 
In some parts of the country, wolves are doing well. But overall, they occupy much less land than before. Wolves used to live across most of the U.S. Now they’re in fewer than a dozen states. 

 
Experts disagree about the goal of the ESA. Some say the law should protect an animal until it has reclaimed its original area. Others argue that as long as a species is not at risk of extinction, it doesn’t belong on the endangered-species list.
David Bernhardt was secretary of the interior in October 2020. That’s when the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announced its plan to delist the gray wolf. According to Bernhardt, the wolf “is neither a threatened nor [an] endangered species.” 

But Jason Rylander, of Defenders of Wildlife, disagrees. He worries that the wolf population will drop again: “We have to ask, ‘Is the work of recovery really done for this species?’ In our view, it’s not. There are still too many places where the population hasn’t come back.”
 

What’s Next
Environmental groups are suing the government over its decision to remove the gray wolf from the endangered-species list. Rylander hopes that no matter what, people and wolves can live together peacefully. His group is finding ways to make that happen. These include portable wire fences to keep wolves away from livestock. 
For now, protection of nearly all wolves is up to the states. In November 2020, Colorado passed a law that would protect the wolves within its borders. 

Gray Wolf Facts
The gray wolf is a fierce predator. It has long teeth and powerful jaws. It can chase prey at more than 35 miles per hour. A typical male weighs about 100 pounds. It’s more than six feet long. (That includes its bushy tail, which is one or two feet long.) 
Wolves live in packs of up to 30 adults and pups. They communicate with one another using facial expressions and the positions of their bodies and tails. Howling helps members of a pack stay in touch.

African elephants are becoming more endangered. That’s according to a March 25 report by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The group determines how likely animals are to become extinct. 
There are two species of African elephant. Savanna elephants roam grasslands. Forest elephants live in the woods.  
Over the past 50 years, the savanna elephant population has fallen by 60%. The IUCN lists the animal as endangered. The forest elephant population has fallen by more than 86% over 31 years. These animals are critically endangered. 
The last time the IUCN looked at African elephants was in 2008. Back then, they were listed as vulnerable. That’s the category before endangered. 
There are two main threats to elephants: poaching and habitat loss. Bruno Oberle is the IUCN director. He hopes the report inspires action. “Africa’s elephants play key roles in ecosystems, economies, and in our collective imagination all over the world,” Oberle says.

272,272,An Electric Future,"{'Environment', 'Technology'}","
General Motors (GM) is one of the world’s major automakers. In January, the company set a goal: It would stop selling gas-powered cars by 2035. It will make more battery-powered vehicles. 
This is a big moment for the auto industry. Scientists say it’s crucial to move away from gas-powered vehicles. Doing so will fight climate change. Transportation causes about 25% of global . Three-quarters of that is from road travel.
Countries are taking action. In China, most new vehicles sold must be electric by 2035. The United Kingdom, Ireland, and the Netherlands will ban sales of new gas-powered cars in 2030.
Venkat Viswanathan is a professor of mechanical engineering at Carnegie Mellon University. That’s in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He told TIME for Kids, “It is now abundantly clear that electric is the future.”

A Cleaner Option
Electric cars run on lithium-ion batteries. That’s what powers our mobile devices.
Making these batteries has an environmental cost. Lithium is taken from the earth, like the oil used to make gasoline. But the long-term cost is much smaller. “When you use up a battery, you can recycle the material,” Jessika Trancik says. She’s a researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. That’s in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Electric cars have another environmental effect. They need energy to recharge. They get the energy from power plants. These places burn . But countries can switch to cleaner energy sources, such as wind and solar power. If they do, electric vehicles will get cleaner too. Even now, they’re cleaner than cars that run on gas.

Driving Ahead
Government policies can make electric cars accessible to everyone. China has invested in electric-car production for years. A basic electric car sells there for as little as $5,000.
Charging stations must be made widely available. President Joe Biden plans to build half a million new charging stations in the U.S. by 2030. Trancik hopes this will be done fairly. “It’s important to put chargers where many different people can have access to them,” she says. “Not just wealthier people.”

Last year, only 5% of the approximately 67 million new cars sold worldwide were electric (see “On the Rise”). Sales will probably increase. For Viswanathan, electric cars are just the beginning. He sees a future of solar-powered homes and electric flying cars. “Your entire life will run on batteries,” he says. “It will be a totally new world.”
On the Rise 
Worldwide, the sales of electric vehicles are going up. This chart shows that by 2030, about half of new cars sold could be electric.

 The popularity of electric cars will rise as prices come down. That’s happening faster than expected. Technology is improving. One reason for this is that governments are investing in battery development. Soon, a plug-in vehicle may be as cheap as a gas-powered car.

A member of the Wiikwemkoong First Nation, Autumn Peltier, 16, lives in Canada. She advocates for clean water for Canada’s  population. TFK Kid Reporter Pranav Mukhi spoke with her about the power of youth activism. 
1. What does water mean to First Nations people?
We believe that we are part of the land, and that we come from the land. We learn that we have a right to protect the land and protect the water.
2. What problems do indigenous communities in Canada face when it comes to water?
They often have little access to clean drinking water because of landfills, oil spills, or old mining sites. For more than 20 years, these communities have been told to boil their water [to make it safe].
3. I heard that you took your concerns to Justin Trudeau, the prime minister of Canada.
I met him in 2016. I told him, “I’m very unhappy with the choices you made and the broken promises to my people,” and I started crying. He said, “I will protect the water.”
4. What has the prime minister done since then?
He promised to solve all “boil water”  in Canada by March 2021. But there are still 54 advisories in First Nations communities, 44 in Ontario alone.
5. You represent 39 First Nations in Ontario as the chief water commissioner. What is your role?
I take ideas, questions, and concerns about water from the communities to our council leaders. And I have a say in decision-making.
6. Do you ever work with other water activists?
I know a lot of children my age, some older and some younger, who are doing the same work. It gives me hope and courage to know there are others out there.
7. How can we protect the world’s water?
There are industries that are trying to do things like dump toxic waste into the Great Lakes. We we can try to talk to them and raise our concerns. Clean drinking water is a basic human right.
8. What would you tell kids who want to speak out on behalf of others or the environment?
It is important to speak up for those who are too afraid to speak up. It can be as easy as writing to your local leaders. The message is so much more powerful when it comes from a young person. You can be the light in someone’s darkness.

275,275,Grow Your Own Garden,"{'Environment', 'Opinion'}","
Starting a garden might seem daunting. But with a little planning and a few tips, you’ll be growing in no time.
One of the key things to remember is to grow what you love. This way, you’ll be sure to enjoy the process. You can grow vegetables. If you don’t like vegetables, try fruits or flowers. If you’re allergic to flowers, try cacti and other succulents. 
You can grow a garden to feed yourself and your family. You can also help people who don’t have enough nutritious food to eat. That’s an issue I care about deeply. There are many different things you can grow and many different reasons to grow. Find your passion.
Simple Steps
Once you decide what type of garden you’d like to start, you’ll need to plan a few things before getting to work. First, decide where your garden will be. Find a location that gets good sunlight. Maybe you live in an apartment and don’t have a yard. No problem! You can start a garden in containers. You can even grow one in old rain boots.    
Next, pick the right soil. This is important for an  garden. An expert at a gardening store can advise you on the best soil for your needs. 
Now choose your plants. Will you start with seeds or seedlings? Growing from seeds is often less expensive. And it’s satisfying, because you get to watch the growth from seed to plant. But growing from seedlings, or young plants, is easier. There’s a better chance your plant will grow big enough to . 
Get Planting
You’re ready to plant your garden! I suggest planting right before the start of the growing season. Then the plants can adapt to the soil. If you’re a new gardener, start small so you don’t get overwhelmed. Once you know how to plant a garden, you can grow new things season after season. 
 Soon your flowers will bloom or your fruits and vegetables will appear. Share flowers with neighbors to brighten their day, or bring extra veggies to a family who needs them. As I like to say, “Be a good human!”

276,276,Mystery of the Sea,"{'Environment', 'Science'}","
Legend has it that in the 1970s, a boat captain spotted a green banana peel floating above a sinkhole off Florida’s coast. That sinkhole became known as the Green Banana. 
A sinkhole is a hollow place in the Earth in which water collects. The Green Banana starts about 160 feet below the ocean’s surface. It goes another 265 feet down. Scientists think it formed thousands of years ago. Sea levels were lower then, exposing  rock. Over time, rain carved a hole in the rock. Sea levels have since risen, covering the hole in water. 
Emily Hall is a scientist. She works at the Mote Marine Laboratory, in Florida. This past summer, Hall led the first scientific mission to the Green Banana. Its findings will help us better understand sinkholes. “We’re learning about how unique they are,” Hall told TIME for Kids. 
Diving to Discover
The seawater in sinkholes is unusual. It’s richer in nutrients than the surrounding waters. Algae feed on these nutrients. Small fish feed on the algae. Larger fish feed on the small fish. Because of this diversity of life, Hall calls sinkholes “ of the sea.” 
But there could be a problem. The nutrients might be causing red tide. This happens when algae grow out of control. Some species of algae release toxins that kill marine life. Hall says these algae species were found in the Green Banana. “Could there be a connection between red tide and nutrients in these holes?” she asks. “We hope to investigate in the future.”
Mission Challenges
Exploring the Green Banana isn’t easy. Only divers trained to swim below 130 feet can reach it. Jim Culter is one of these divers. “We tried to reduce the number of divers going in because [of the] risk,” he says.

277,277,Kids Care About: Polar Bears,"{'Environment', 'Animals'}","
TFK Kid Reporter Victoria Hanson cares about polar bears. She talked to experts about why these animals are in danger and how people can help.
Polar bears live mostly within the Arctic Circle. They’ve been on the endangered-species list since 2008. 

I asked Carter Roberts, president and CEO of the World Wildlife Fund, why. His answer was that global warming is to blame. “As warm temperatures melt sea ice, they melt the bears’ habitat,” Roberts told me. “And as the ice melts, scientists predict that polar bear populations will be devastated.”

So I did some research. Global warming is caused by the burning of fossil fuels. This releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Over the past 150 years, people have used more and more engines and other machines. These devices burn fossil fuels such as coal and oil. 

What’s being done about global warming? I checked in with Benjamin Wilson, an environmental lawyer, to find out. He told me that the United States government has laws that are “designed to protect people, animals, and the environment as a whole.” 

Wilson’s law firm works to make sure companies follow these rules. It also works with companies that are developing solar and wind energy. These energy sources will reduce the amount of fossil fuels people need and slow global warming—helping to save the polar bear’s habitat.
You Can Help, Too!

Do you love polar bears as much as I do? You can help stop global warming and save their habitat. Here are some ways to reduce the burning of fossil fuels.
 When traveling a short distance, ride a bike instead of riding in a car.
 Turn off the lights when you leave a room.
 Take shorter showers.
 Close doors immediately behind you, so heat doesn’t escape.

278,278,The Butterfly Problem,"{'United States', 'Animals'}","
For 23 years, the Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation has held an annual monarch butterfly count. Volunteers visit spots on the West Coast where monarchs are known to gather. They count the insects to learn about the health of the species.
Xerces started counting in 1997. That year, it found more than a million monarchs. By 2018, that number had dropped to fewer than 30,000. In 2020, Xerces counted just 1,914 monarchs. 
A study was published in March in the journal Science. Researchers looked at decades’ worth of data on butterflies in the western United States. They found that butterfly populations are shrinking by almost 2% each year. 
“It  each year,” Matt Forister, the study’s lead author, told TIME for Kids. “Over time, it’s really bad.” 
Cause and Effect
Monarchs aren’t the only species of butterfly whose population is dropping. According to the study, most butterfly populations are.
Why? For one thing, humans are taking over their habitat. Butterflies need flowering plants for food and to lay eggs on. When new buildings and roads replace fields and forests, these plants are lost. Pesticides used by farmers and gardeners also harm the insects.
Forister’s research suggests climate change is to blame, as well. His team looked at “nice, natural areas” mostly unaffected by humans. Those are places one might expect to find many butterflies. But even there, the numbers were down. That led Forister and his team to believe that warming temperatures in the fall are harming the insects.
How to Help 
Growing flowering plants, like local milkweed, and avoiding pesticides can make a yard safe for butterflies. It’s also good to let it get messy. Butterflies use fallen leaves for protection.
“Insects are in our backyards, even if we don’t always see them,” Forister says. “Having a yard free of  . . . helps a lot.”

279,279,Return of the Cicadas,"{'United States', 'Earth Science'}","
This spring, parts of the United States will witness a rare natural event. Trillions of Brood 10 cicadas are expected to emerge in mid-May. The insects have spent 17 years underground. They will likely be around until late June or July. 
The cicadas come out to mate. Across 15 states, they'll create a buzz as loud as a lawn mower. That's their mating call. It's the male cicada that makes all that noise, Michael Raupp told TIME for Kids. Raupp is an  professor at the University of Maryland, College Park. ""It's going to be a big boy band up in the treetops,"" he says.
Within a few weeks, the female cicadas will lay hundreds of eggs. Then, as suddenly as they appeared, the cicadas will die. ""This unique event happens nowhere else on the planet,"" Raupp says. ""The abundance of these cicadas is going to be amazing.""
What's the Buzz?
Brood 10 is a family of periodical cicadas. That means the insects come out every once in a while instead of every year or few years. 
The cicadas emerge when soil temperatures reach 64°F. They crawl out from under the ground and fly up into trees. If you're standing outside, one might land on you. But don't worry: Cicadas aren't dangerous. The insects don't bite or sting. They might just give you a friendly little poke. 
Up in the trees, female cicadas lay their eggs. Then the insects fall to the ground and die. About six weeks later, the eggs develop into nymphs, or young insects. They tumble out of the trees and dig themselves into the earth. That's where they'll spend the next 17 years, feeding on root sap until they're ready to come out again. 
Raupp says it's a drama you just can't miss. ""There's going to be birth. There's going to be death. There's going to be . There's going to be romance. There are going to be songs,"" he says. ""Just go out and enjoy these things. This is only going to happen a handful of times in your lifetime.""

280,280,Should People Be Rewarded for Recycling?,"{'Debate', 'Opinion'}","
Boots is a company in the United Kingdom. Its stores sell health and beauty products. In September 2020, Boots began a program that rewards customers for recycling empty product packaging. Participants get points to use toward store purchases. In the program’s first few months, Boots recycled more than a ton of plastic. 
Should governments give rewards for recycling too? Some say people shouldn’t need a reward to keep the planet clean. Others say any initiative that encourages people to recycle is helpful. We asked TIME for Kids readers to weigh in. Here’s what four of them said.

Conor Maples, 11
Wheaton, Illinois
People should be rewarded for recycling. San Francisco, California, has a program that rewards recycling. San Francisco has one of the highest recycling rates in the United States. Meanwhile, Chicago, Illinois, doesn’t enforce recycling laws enough, and it has one of the lowest recycling rates in the country. By rewarding recycling, many cities would be cleaner.  

Ruhi Patel, 9
Trumbull, Connecticut
Even though people don’t recycle enough, those who do know that the reward is having a cleaner environment for future generations. What can be more rewarding than this? Rewards will only encourage people to buy more disposable items rather than take the right steps to reduce the amount they’re producing in the first place. 

Elizabeth Card, 10
Queens, New York
If people get rewarded, they will recycle more. A good example of this is deposit-return schemes, which pay back a small amount of money when customers recycle an item. According to the United Kingdom’s Environmental Audit Committee, countries with deposit-return schemes have a much higher rate of recycling than other countries.

Andrew Horan, 9
Pelham, New York
People shouldn’t be rewarded for recycling. They should recycle anyway because the world has a lot of waste. Recycling is just a part of being a good citizen of Planet Earth. Do people need a reward for throwing garbage in the trash? No. It’s just the right thing to do. The same goes for recycling. It should be a part of everyday life now.

For our Earth Day special issue, we’re featuring three new books about our home—and the plants and animals that live here.
Hello, Earth!
Hello, Earth! Poems to Our Planet explores the extraordinary place we call home. Each poem is dedicated to the Earth’s wonders. These include its volcanoes, deserts, oceans, and more. Joyce Sidman is the book’s author. She told TIME for Kids she was inspired to use poetry to show young readers the beauty and importance of the environment. “It’s a wonderful way of writing about the world that shows us the mysterious . . . things that go on in nature,” she says. —By Karena Phan 
How to Change Everything
 How to Change Everything is a tool kit for young activists who want to protect the planet. The book explains both the chemistry and the politics of climate change. It was written by Naomi Klein. She has been writing about environmental activism for more than 15 years. “During that time, the movement has gotten younger and younger,” Klein told TFK. She believes that kids have the power to make a difference. Klein wants readers to speak up. “Young people are already leading the climate movement,” she says. “[They’re] raising the alarm and leading the way toward solutions.” —By Ellen Nam
The Elephant Doctor of India
 The Elephant Doctor of India tells the true story of Dr. Kushal Konwar Sarma. He grew up in a village in Assam, India. As a young boy, he loved elephants. But the elephants living in Assam didn’t have proper medical care. This motivated Sarma to become a veterinarian when he got older. Since realizing his dream, he has traveled all over Assam to heal and save elephants. Janie Chodosh tells Sarma’s story. She told TFK she hopes it will give kids “a sense of wonder” and “inspire them to care about the natural world.” —By Rebecca Mordechai

282,282,Sounds of the Jungle,"{'Books', 'Arts'}","
Sandra Boynton is the author and illustrator of more than 60 children’s books. Yo-Yo Ma is a world-renowned cellist. They came together to create a short, animated video to accompany Jungle Night, a new book by Boynton that takes little ones on a journey through a sleeping jungle. Boynton wrote, illustrated, and directed the creation of the Jungle Night video, while Ma used his cello to bring to life the sounds of snoozing jungle creatures. Ma also performed in the soundtrack that accompanies the book. 
The Jungle Night book and video were released today. TFK Kid Reporter Sophia Hou spoke with Boynton and Ma about their collaboration and what inspires them. 
Sandra Boynton
1. Can you tell me about your book?
The book is called Jungle Night, and it’s a board book, like many of my books. It comes with a free download of two audio tracks: one with narration and a mystical handpan track—a book narration done by my son Keith, and Yo-Yo Ma does animal snores on his cello in the background. Part two is an instrumental performance.
2. What inspired you to write Jungle Night and to include music in it?
A friend of mine who is a novelist is good friends with Yo-Yo Ma, and I didn’t know him. This [was] a couple years ago. Her name is Ann Patchett. She said, “You two should absolutely work together. You both have grandchildren, he loves children, and you’re both kind of like children yourself: very playful, and just lively. It would be a great collaboration.” And then he was coming to perform at Tanglewood Music Center, which is a summer concert place in the Berkshires [in Massachusetts], not far from my house. Ann was visiting, and I said, “We should go see that.”
3. How did you and Yo-Yo Ma come together to create the book and music?
Well, we met at the soundcheck. He was performing the six Cello Suites by Bach. It’s a solo performance, which is extraordinary, for an instrumentalist who carries an entire performance as a soloist on the stage with no one else there. It’s the greatest thing I’ve ever seen on stage. The cello’s my favorite instrument.
4. What was your favorite aspect of collaborating with Yo-Yo Ma?
Just his playfulness, just his openness to anything, his good nature. He’s tireless, he wants to keep trying things, and it’s just about as exciting as collaboration can be.
5. Is this your first book with an animated video?
I’ve created a lot of videos, some animated, some live-action. Sometimes they’re before I do a book, and sometimes they’re after. Books are two-dimensional, and music is music-dimensional. To be able to also then have a visual component, a moving visual component, is exciting.
6. How did you come up with the different noises that the animals make as they sleep?
Some of the sounds I can’t remember how I came up with them, because I wrote them so long ago. What was fun is then adding more animals and saying, “OK, if the tiger does zeee-zooo-haaa, and if the cheetah does chee-chee-taaah . . . what do the monkeys do?” [The monkeys go chatter-chooo chatter-chooo.] Like everything, it’s an evolution.
7. What do you enjoy most about writing for children?
Oh my goodness, everything. People who write for children, I think, are writing for themselves first, do you know what I mean? You know, I remember my childhood very vividlyI think when you’re writing for children, it’s first for your own childhood. And then—I have four children, they’re all grown now—to be writing for them when they were little. Books mattered to me so much as a child. The exciting thing is to imagine that maybe my books matter a lot to specific children.
Yo-Yo Ma
1. Have you ever made music to be a soundtrack for a book before Jungle Night?
I’ve done soundtracks, but not for books. So this is the very first time that I did a soundtrack for a book, which is very exciting. It’s Sandy Boynton who thought up the idea [of] the specific sounds that the animals would make in Jungle Night, and then I would try to match [them] on the cello.
2. Did you visualize the illustrations while you were playing the music?
I was always looking at the animals and creatures. And Sandy actually is a wonderful musician. So here you have an author who is a writer and illustrator, and has a very vivid imagination, and has a very specific idea for what the sound of each animal is going to be. I tried to match her imagination.
3. What was the most exciting aspect of creating the soundtrack?
We were doing this all virtually. I think the exciting part was working with the author, with Ms. Boynton, in terms of really being able to fit in and capture what she was imagining—because as you know, she has a very particular kind of humor and sensibility about what she does. I just really wanted to get the feelings of what she had for the music and just to get it right according to the way she thought of it. And that was a lot of fun to try to do because I admire her work a lot.
4. Was there anything that was challenging?
It was more like an adventure. All the challenges are welcome. Whatever it is, if it doesn’t sound quite right, it’s a challenge. Well, let’s try something else. So you kind of [are] just always moving forward. And so I think challenge not in the negative way, but challenge as in, like, “Yeah, let’s try to get that just so.”
5. What was your favorite animal sound to play in Jungle Night?
Oh my gosh, I think it was the elephant. Because if you hear it, not only does the elephant make that very loud noise where it wakes up the whole forest, the whole jungle—but you can also hear the echo afterward. So it’s a grrrr, and then you go whoooo. You hear the echo that echoes through the forest so you get the feeling of space. You get the feeling like this is not only a sound that’s happening in one place, but it kind of reverberates throughout the whole jungle. And that’s the thing that ends up waking everybody up.

283,283,Exploring Mars,"{'Science', 'Space'}","
On February 18, NASA’s Perseverance rover landed on Mars. Its mission: to seek evidence of past  life. Something may have thrived on the planet billions of years ago.
The rover’s 300 million–mile journey to Mars’s orbit took nearly seven months. But its descent through the planet’s atmosphere took just seven minutes. The car-sized rover fell at 12,100 miles per hour. Air friction raised the temperature on its heat shield to 2,370°F.

The friction also acted as a brake. Within minutes, the ship slowed down. The heat shield came off, a parachute opened, and Perseverance drifted to the ground.
Cheers went up at Mission Control in California. “The team is beside itself,” NASA engineer Rob Manning said. “It’s so .”

Looking for Clues
The rover will be on Mars for about two years. It will explore the Jezero Crater, an area 28 miles wide. Three and a half billion years ago, it was a lake. Water flowed through channels in the crater’s rim. The planet’s atmosphere was thick and warm. Those conditions can support life.
Later, Mars lost most of its atmosphere and nearly all of its water. The planet turned into a frigid desert. But if there was ever life on Mars, traces could remain. Fossils might be found in the dried-up lake.

The rover will search for these fossils. But it will look for other signs of past life, too. Rocky, wavy mounds might lie along the crater’s edges. They could have been made by colonies, or groups, of microbes.
Tools of the Trade
NASA ground controllers on Earth will set up the rover’s scientific instruments. These include:
a camera for seeking signs of past microbial life; an X-ray instrument for studying tiny particles;a rock-busting laser; andan instrument that will test the possibility of making oxygen out of carbon dioxide. This technology could help future astronauts on Mars produce breathable air and rocket fuel.
The rover also carries a small helicopter called Ingenuity. It will make test flights. On future Mars missions, helicopters could allow for exploration of hills and mountains.

The Perseverance rover is the ninth American spacecraft to set down on Mars. The only other nation to get there was the former Soviet Union, now mostly part of Russia. Will Perseverance discover proof of  life? The possibility is thrilling to imagine.
Message From Space
The Mars rover landing was exciting enough. But NASA added a twist: a secret message.The message was hidden in the pattern on the rover’s parachute (pictured). The pattern translates into binary code, the language of computers.

Maxence Abela is a computer science student in France. He and his dad, Jerome, cracked the code and posted the message on Twitter. It reads: “Dare mighty things.” That’s the motto of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, in California.

On March 12, Americans began receiving payments from the United States government. This is part of President Joe Biden’s plan to help people. Many have struggled during the pandemic.
Biden signed the American Rescue Plan, worth nearly $2 trillion. That was on March 11. It’s designed to help repair the economy, which was damaged by the pandemic. It’s the second-largest stimulus bill in U.S. history. The largest was worth more than $2 trillion. President Donald Trump signed that bill. 
The new bill provides one-time payments of up to $1,400 to those who qualify. Billions of dollars will go toward reopening schools. The bill will also help increase vaccine distribution. 
Republican lawmakers say the bill is too big. But polls show that 70% of Americans support it. Those results are from Reuters and Pew Research Center. “This legislation is about giving the backbone of this nation . . . the people who keep this country going . . . a fighting chance,” Biden said in a statement.

Matthew Walzer was born with cerebral palsy. The disability affects his walking, balance, and . “There were different things I had to do and use, to overcome [my challenges],” he told TIME for Kids.
By 16, Walzer was able to put clothes on by himself. But he still couldn’t tie his shoes. So in 2012, he wrote a letter to the shoe company Nike. He asked if Nike could make shoes to meet his needs. With Walzer’s input, the company will release the Nike Go FlyEase on March 19. They are sneakers that slip on hands-free.
One in four adults lives with a disability. That’s according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But many say the fashion industry has been slow to make clothes that are accessible. People are working to change that.
Functional Fashion
Gabby Kim Leung is a teacher and the caretaker of her husband, Ben. He’s paralyzed from the waist down. Leung has had trouble finding clothes for him. “I was shopping for weeks, and realized that there was just nothing out there,” she says. “We don’t have any options besides sweatpants and T-shirts.” 
Open Style Lab teaches people about more-inclusive clothing. Grace Jun is its chief executive officer. She says designers tell her it’s “too hard to make  fashion. [But] that is not true.” Designs can have stretchier material, or Velcro instead of buttons.
Christina Mallon, chief brand officer for the group, is paralyzed in both arms. Mallon believes fashion helps people express themselves. “Not being able to express yourself is one of the hardest parts of being disabled,” she says. “It’s just so ignored.”
Some brands have adaptive fashion lines, but Walzer wants more change. “We’ve made great strides since I was young,” he says. “But there’s still so much more work that needs to be done.” Walzer encourages those who feel left out to call for change, like he did when he wrote to Nike. “Don’t be afraid to speak up,” he says.

Movies, TV, and even Greek myths show dolphins as helpful, playful creatures. “The world loves a good dolphin story,” Blake Morton told TIME for Kids. He’s a scientist who studies animals. “I think one reason for that is we see a lot of ourselves mirrored in their behavior.” 
Morton used scientific methods to test his theory . The result is a new report. It confirms that humans and dolphins share personality traits. The report was published in January, in the Journal of Comparative Psychology. 
The study involved 134 bottlenose dolphins at facilities in different countries. Each animal was rated with a “dolphin personality questionnaire.” The questionnaire consisted of more than 40 items. It included adjectives such as stubborn and playful. Staff members at the facilities gave every dolphin a score based on how well each item described the animal’s behavior. From these ratings, Morton and his team were  able to spot personality traits common in dolphins.
The results show that dolphins and humans share certain traits. These include curiosity and .
The Big Picture
Morton’s study and others like it teach us about different species. They also teach us about ourselves. “My kind of work stems from the spirit of trying to understand what made humans the way we are,” Morton says. “One way we can do that is to compare our behavior to the rest of the animal kingdom.”
Scientists are studying many animal species, from apes in Africa to reptiles in North America. They want to learn what makes humans different from other animals and what makes us the same.
It’s a puzzle, Morton says: “It takes thousands of careful papers being published before you start to see the puzzle coming together.” He compares science to pointillism. That’s an art style in which someone makes a painting with lots of tiny dots. “Take a step back and look at all those little single points of work,” Morton says. “You’ll see a big picture come into view.”

Computer  are instructions that tell machines to solve problems and make predictions. They help us use our smartphones and stream videos. Someday, they’ll drive our cars.
Can algorithms make us more creative? Some artists think so. They are using algorithms to produce surprising artworks. Here are three of those artists.
Painting With Robots

Sougwen Chung uses computers to be more creative. Chung is based in New York City. She works with a set of robots called DOUG. DOUG can be a robotic arm fitted with a pencil or paintbrush, or it can be a team of robots.
Chung programmed DOUG to paint. She gathered 20 years of her drawings and made digital copies, then saved these copies in DOUG’s memory bank. As Chung paints on a canvas, so does the robot. From “memory,” it makes a stroke that Chung might make. Artist and machine work together.
Chung and DOUG often perform for an audience. The artwork they make is always a surprise, and that’s the fun of it, Chung says. “The second I know what’s happening in those performances, I’ll probably stop doing them. For now, I like the energy it gives to the work.” 
Cutting-Edge Architecture

“We are drawn to things that make us curious,” says Michael Hansmeyer. He’s an architect based in Germany and Switzerland.
Take the column pictured above. It started as a simple shape: a . Hansmeyer programmed a computer to fold a digital cylinder again and again. This produced countless new details. The result would have been impossible to draw.
A laser cutter shaped the actual column. About 3,000 slices of cardboard were made and stacked on top of one another. Hansmeyer has also made columns out of sandstone using a 3D printer.The columns were put on display. Signs read “Do Not Touch.” “But everybody reached out and touched them,” Hansmeyer says. “In a way, that was the greatest compliment.” 
Color By Numbers

Ben Shneiderman, a computer scientist at the University of Maryland, doesn’t call himself an artist. “But I aspire to be an artist,” he says.
In the 1990s, Shneiderman was looking for a way to see all the data contained on a computer hard drive. It dawned on him to make a digital map. He designed an algorithm that could organize information into shapes of different sizes and colors. The maps were not only useful: They looked like art.
Shneiderman has mapped everything from sports statistics to population growth. Several of his works now belong to the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. “There’s a lot of unity between art and science,” he says. “You don’t have to choose one or the other. You can have both in your life.”

More than a billion tons of food are wasted each year, according to a new report from the United Nations. That’s 17% of the food produced globally in a year.
Most waste happens at home, the report says. People buy too much food. They also throw it away too soon because of the date on the package. Waste happens in restaurants and stores, too. Concern about food waste has grown because of the toll food production takes on the environment. Farming, packaging, and transporting food all produce greenhouse-gas emissions.
Experts say governments need to do more to track food waste and promote better habits. Richard Swannell is one of the report’s authors. He hopes awareness will lead people to value food more. “Food is too important to waste,” he says.

The majority of shoppers in the United States have been eating at home more often since the pandemic began. That’s according to a 2020 report from Acosta, a marketing company. This means people are cooking more, too. And one way to make meals more delicious is science.
“There’s loads of chemistry in how different ingredients react to one another,” Kristin Sargianis told TIME for Kids. She’s the deputy editor at America’s Test Kitchen Kids. Sargianis says that “you can come up with your own recipe or  a recipe” if you take time to learn the science behind cooking. 

Chef’s Creations
Samin Nosrat is a professional chef. She relies on science when creating recipes. Right now, Nosrat is developing a pizza dough recipe for kids. 
Many bakers use a stand mixer to  dough. Kneading develops gluten. Gluten is a protein. It helps dough swell into a light, chewy bread. “But a lot of people don’t have stand mixers,” Nosrat says. She wanted to find a solution. So her recipe calls for more water than other pizza dough recipes. This means less kneading is required and more gluten can develop on its own.
Say “Cheese!”	
Science can also be used to adjust a recipe you enjoy. Take grilled cheese, for example. It’s delicious. But the cheese might not always melt smoothly. 
Sargianis has a tip. To make velvety grilled cheese, avoid aged cheeses, like extra-sharp cheddar. Cheeses age in a climate-controlled room. That develops flavor. But as time passes, a cheese loses water through evaporation. The resulting cheese has a drier texture.
It doesn’t melt well. Sargianis says that a young cheese, like mozzarella, is “full of water, and will be gooey” when melted. 
Whether making a favorite dish or a new one, getting curious about why foods taste and feel the way they do can make you a better cook. “The nice thing about cooking,” Nosrat says, “is that usually there is a ‘why’ to be explained.”

296,296,8 Questions for Ainissa Ramirez,"{'People', 'Science'}","
TFK Kid Reporter Donnell Meekins talks with scientist Ainissa Ramirez about how science has shaped our world, and how it might shape the future.
1. Why did you write The Alchemy of Us, a book about inventions?
As a materials scientist, I like making things. If you’re making an airplane, a materials scientist has to decide: What’s the best material for the job? So I am interested in other people’s inventions, because they can help me figure out how to make new things.
2. Why is it important to get people excited about science?
Most of the world’s big questions involve science. It makes our cell phones possible. Someday, we’ll have driverless cars. I think if people knew more about science, they would feel more connected to the world.
3. What’s one big problem science could help solve?
Climate change. We need better green technology, like solar cells, so we can use energy from the sun. We need better magnets, so that wind  can make energy more efficiently.

4. You’ve written about bias in technology. Can you explain what that is?
Here’s an example. Some water faucets have a light sensor that  your hand. That sensor may be designed only for lighter skin. If I were to put my hand in front of it, water wouldn’t come out. Whoever made this sensor probably tested it on themselves and their friends. But they didn’t test it on someone who had a different color skin.
5. I read that a TV show inspired you to become a scientist. Can you talk about that?
The show was 3-2-1 Contact. It had kids solving problems. I said, “That’s what I want to do.”
6. Can science fiction teach us about science?
Science fiction can help us imagine the future. It can show us which way we should go with technology, and which way we should not go.
7. How is science related to other school subjects, like art or English?
We separate subjects in school, but in life, they are not separated. Science happens in history. It touches culture. Scientists can be influenced by art or writing.
8. Do you have advice for budding scientists?
If science class gets hard, tell a teacher. Everyone should get a shot at science. Find others who like science, and encourage one another. And when something breaks at home, ask your parents, “Can we take this apart?” Just to see how things work.

Look outside. What do you see? Are there birds in the trees? Are there bugs crawling around? What can you discover about these creatures by watching them? With The Outdoor Scientist, you’ll learn to make scientific observations about the natural world. The book comes with fun facts about plants, animals, and insects, as well as interactive projects you can do with friends and family.
Temple Grandin is the book’s author. She’s also an inventor and a scientist. The Outdoor Scientist was inspired by her childhood. “I grew up looking at bugs and leaves,” she told TFK. Grandin encourages readers to explore the world around them. “Kids today need to get outside and just observe nature,” she says. “Observation is an important part of science.”

The first episode of Emily’s Wonder Lab, on Netflix, is about things that glow. Host Emily Calandrelli teaches a group of kids to make fluorescent paint. One exclaims that he added too much cornstarch. “Don’t worry,” Calandrelli tells him. “Science is all about trial and error.”
Calandrelli wants kids to know that failure is an important part of science. “Failure is not a bad thing,” she told TIME for Kids. “It’s okay to mess up, because that means you’re learning something.”
Calandrelli has four degrees in science and engineering. On the show, she shares her love of science with kids. Together, they do experiments. In one episode, they run across a pool of a gooey material called oobleck. In another, they make rainbow explosions. “Science is how we understand how the universe works,” Calandrelli says. “It’s like magic that you get to understand.”

299,299,Making History,"{'History', 'World'}","
Brighid Pulskamp has made hundreds of face masks for the people of the Navajo Nation. The tribe lives in Utah, Arizona, and New Mexico. Pulskamp wants us to remember how the Navajo handled the pandemic. “Our people are resilient,” she told TIME for Kids.
Pulskamp has donated masks to a museum. The Autry Museum of the American West is in Los Angeles, California. In April, it put out a call for contributions. It asked for face masks, family recipes, and stories about how people were living through the pandemic.
The Autry is not alone. Museums everywhere are collecting items. When the pandemic is over, things like hand sanitizer and grocery lists will become valuable to historians. These ordinary objects will tell the story of how we experienced this life-changing event.

Picture This
Eventually, museums hope to collect things like medical equipment and social-distancing signs. For now, they’re mostly collecting digital artifacts, like photographs.
Maria Hagstrup is a  at Vesthimmerlands Museum, in Denmark. Lockdown began there in March 2020. Hagstrup grabbed her camera. “I walked around, taking photos of­ what did not happen!” she says.

In Hagstrup’s photos and in others sent to her museum, cities are deserted. There was a “feeling of great loneliness” everywhere, she says. But there were lighter moments, too: “A dentist in equipment that looks like something from space,” she says. “Or people singing from their balconies.”
Personal Stories
The California Historical Society (CHS) has asked people to share their stories. Some are from kids. Xiomara, 13, is from Marina, California. She describes staying home during the pandemic. She has missed her grandmother. “I like to let her know that I love her,” she writes. “I could do that through the phone, but it’s just not the same as hugging someone and spending the day with them.”

Frances Kaplan is a librarian and  at CHS. She says stories like Xiomara’s will help future generations understand the emotional impact of the pandemic. “People are not shying away from personal details,” she says.
That’s what museums are counting on. “History is made by ordinary people and their everyday lives,” Aaron Bryant says. He’s a curator at the National Museum of African American History and Culture, in Washington, D.C. “Even ordinary things”—like face masks—“can reflect history in an important way.”

What’s Your Story?
How has your life changed during the pandemic? Historians want to know how people are spending their time, what challenges they face, and what brings them moments of joy.
Libraries, historical societies, and museums in your area might have websites where you can submit your account of pandemic life. You may also be able to share pictures of pandemic-related objects. These might include grocery lists or art projects you’ve created while at home.

300,300,After the Storm,"{'United States', 'Weather'}","
Texas residents are still recovering from a winter storm that hit several states in mid-February. Extreme cold caused much of the state’s power grid to fail. “We were woefully unprepared for this kind of cold,” said Texas state representative Ron Reynolds.
Millions of Texans lost electricity for days as temperatures sank into the 20s. Frozen pipes meant no running water. At least 70 people died in the United States.
Texas gets much of its electricity from natural gas. That system isn’t built for such cold. Plus, the state’s electrical grid is not connected to the rest of the country. Other states’ grids are. Oklahoma and Louisiana were also hit by the storm. But their problems were less severe. Their power systems are part of larger grids.
White House climate adviser Gina McCarthy called on Texas officials to create a plan for future storms. “It is going to happen,” she says. “And we need to be . . . resilient and working together as much as possible.”
Stop and Think! Why is last month’s storm in Texas still newsworthy? What lessons can be learned from what happened there?

301,301,This Week in TFK History: Museums,"{'History', 'World'}","
Time flies! The first issue of TIME for Kids was published in September 1995. That means TFK is turning 25. To honor our 25th anniversary, we’re pulling TFK stories from the archives and highlighting them in this space. Each archival issue relates to something in the news today. We hope these stories provide background for the things you’ll read about.

In this week’s cover story, TIME for Kids looks at how museums are documenting the COVID-19 pandemic. They’re doing this so future generations can learn about life during this historic time.
Historians work to help us understand the past. In a November 1998 issue, we wrote about how explorer Franck Goddio found ruins of a palace under the sea. The palace belonged to Cleopatra. She ruled ancient Egypt more than 2,000 years ago. Goddio told TFK that he wished to build an underwater museum at the palace site, so that visitors could marvel at it. “To be there . . . is unbelievable,” he said.

The United States Food and Drug Administration has authorized another vaccine to prevent COVID-19. This one is made by Johnson & Johnson. It’s different from previous vaccines. It requires only one shot instead of two.
This is the third vaccine to be offered in the U.S. A study done across three continents has shown it to be 85% effective at preventing severe COVID-19 cases. It’s 66% effective against moderate cases. Johnson & Johnson expects to deliver 20 million doses to the U.S. in March.

Clinton Lexa loves video games. But playing them hasn’t always been easy. Lexa was born with a disability. It affects a person’s hands. Lexa usually does tasks and activities, such as playing video games, left-handed. “I taught myself,” Lexa told TIME for Kids. “There was no guide.”
Today, Lexa is a professional gamer and one of many people working to make video games more .  are helping. They’re creating games with accessibility settings. And companies are designing controllers so people with disabilities can play.
Games for All
When not gaming, Lexa is an accessibility consultant. This means giving feedback to developers about making video games accessible. One project is an adventure game called Celeste. It has an “assist” mode that lets players change the game’s settings. Lexa helped update the mode’s introduction so more people would feel encouraged to use the mode. The result is challenging while being “more inclusive,” Lexa says.
Can I Play That? is a gaming website. It’s run by Courtney Craven. According to Craven, video games are changing. This is thanks to advocates like Lexa. Craven hopes that one day, developers will focus on accessibility. Then advocates won’t be needed. “We want to not have to exist,” Craven says.
Get Connected
Mark Barlet started the AbleGamers Charity. He says people with disabilities often feel alone. “Social isolation is a pandemic,” Barlet says. “Games are this shared experience.”
AbleGamers helps people with disabilities build gaming controllers that work for them. “Our mission is about combating social isolation,” Barlet says. Tools such as the Xbox Adaptive Controller, which AbleGamers helped design, make this possible. 
Craig Kaufman works for AbleGamers. “We basically had to make sure that the industry was . . . focused on including players with disabilities,” he says. “For the longest time, most people didn’t.”

306,306,Walking is Awesome,"{'Environment', 'Health'}","
Have you ever said “Whoa!” as you watched a basketball player sink a basket? If so, you have felt awe. It’s a strong feeling of wonder or amazement.
Virginia Sturm is a  and a professor at the University of California, San Francisco. “Awe is a positive emotion,” she told TIME for Kids. “When we feel it, we feel smaller in relation to the world around us.” Often, people feel awe in nature.
Sturm led a study. The goal was to see if it’s possible for people to feel more awe by taking “awe walks.”The study focused on two groups of adults. Both groups were asked to walk outdoors for 15 minutes once a week. They were told to pay attention to their surroundings and take a few selfies.
Sturm says one group got extra instructions. People were asked “to try to tap into a childlike sense of wonder . . . and to try to see the world with fresh eyes.”
Both groups answered daily questions. They were asked about their mood. And they sent in their selfies. This went on for eight weeks. Researchers found that people in the “awe walk” group felt happier than those in the other group. The faces in their pictures were small compared to their surroundings. The findings were published last fall in the journal Emotion.
Awe Walks for Kids
Sturm says awe walks can be good for kids. And they’re easy to do. “You don’t have to go somewhere new or take a big trip,” she says. “It could be really quite simple, like noticing new flowers in your backyard or a bird nest on your street.”
Maryam Abdullah is a psychologist. She works at the Greater Good Science Center, in Berkeley, California. She says awe walks can be helpful during the pandemic, when people might be feeling disconnected from others. “Awe is one of those emotions that helps us  ourselves [and] understand our connection to something much bigger,” Abdullah says. “That’s a healthy feeling for young people to experience.”

Kara Winger is the United States women’s record holder in the javelin. She used to train indoors. But after the COVID-19 pandemic hit last year, she couldn’t anymore. So Winger and her husband threaded a 30-foot cable through a metal tube. They ran the cable from their back fence to their house. Winger throws the tube to  throwing a javelin. The tube was once part of a cupcake stand that her husband built for their wedding. “Both were made with love,” Winger told TIME. 

On March 24, 2020, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) postponed the Summer Olympics (see “History Lesson”). Now the rescheduled Summer Olympics are only months away. They’re set to begin in Tokyo, Japan, in July. All over the world, athletes are finding creative ways to keep their bodies and minds sharp.

Staying in Shape
During lockdown periods, a wrestler from Norway did push-ups with his baby on his back. A pentathlete from Poland did squats while holding her dog. And a climber from the U.S. crawled along her kitchen counter. She scaled the underside of her stairs. Then she crawled across her fireplace chimney like Spider-Woman.

Lilly King is a double gold-medalist swimmer. She swam laps in a pond. It’s in Bloomington, Indiana. “Once I saw a snapping turtle, I hightailed it out of there!” King says.
Some Olympic athletes have been able to return to indoor training spaces. Others will need to keep relying on their creativity. In certain areas, COVID-19 numbers are on the rise. 
U.S. fencer Daryl Homer trains in New York City. “[We] don’t know if the gym is going to be open tomorrow,” he says.

Mental Wellness
In May 2020, the IOC surveyed more than 3,000 athletes. Half said “keeping myself motivated” was a major challenge. Nearly a third said “managing my mental health” was hard too. 
Olympic officials say the Tokyo Games will go on. Athletes continue to train. But after last year’s postponement, they know nothing is certain. “It’s tough,” Angelica Delgado says. She’s a U.S. judo athlete. “But if I worried about every possible thing that could go wrong, I’d never compete again.”
 helps. “This is a pandemic that’s affecting everyone in the world,” Matthew Centrowitz says. He’s a U.S. runner. “This is much bigger than us, much bigger than sport.”

Sean McCann is a senior sport psychologist for the U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Committee. He worries about the stress athletes are facing. “It’s been a long haul,” McCann says. “We’ve got to still keep doing the basics and taking care of ourselves physically, socially, emotionally.”
History Lesson
The IOC’s March 2020 announcement was historic. Never before had an Olympic Games been postponed to another year. But Olympic Games have been canceled. 
Cancellations were because of major global conflicts. The 1916 Olympic Games were canceled because of World War I. There was only one set of Olympic Games then. In 1940 and 1944, Winter and Summer Games were canceled. That was because of World War II.

Winter storms began to sweep across the United States on February 11. They slowed distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine in parts of the country. 
Severe weather hit from Washington State to the southern U.S. Snow and ice closed airports and made roads slippery. Millions of people lost electricity as temperatures hit record lows.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention expected delays in vaccine shipments. In several states, vaccination appointments were rescheduled. “We want to protect the safety of everyone involved,” Mike Parson said. He’s the governor of Missouri.
A Texas health center had no power on February 15. Without refrigeration, 8,400 vaccine doses were at risk of spoiling. Officials scrambled to give the shots. 
Other problems, like limited supply, have slowed the vaccine rollout. But it has improved in recent weeks. Each day, nearly 2 million Americans get a shot, says the New York Times.

Zoë Trisha Prinsloo sees lots of plastic waste. The teenager hosts beach cleanups in Cape Town, South Africa. Prinsloo has picked up plastic bottles, straws, and more. Lately, she has noticed an increase in one type of trash. It’s from PPE (personal protective equipment). Her group, Save a Fishie!, saw “eight different kinds of gloves” during a cleanup in 2020. “I find masks more and more regularly, too,” she told TIME for Kids.
People everywhere are wearing PPE. It helps protect against COVID-19. But when PPE is not disposed of properly, it pollutes the environment and endangers wildlife.  and others are concerned about this growing problem.
Plastic Problem
At least 8 million tons of plastic enter oceans each year. That’s according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature. This waste now includes more PPE. Experts say that up to 129 billion face masks and 65 billion gloves are used each month. 
In September 2020, the Ocean  held its yearly International Coastal Cleanup. Participants found tens of thousands of PPE items. George Leonard is the group’s chief scientist. “PPE waste is a significant threat to oceans and marine life,” he told CNN.
PPE waste threatens other wildlife too. Sue Schwar manages South Essex Wildlife Hospital. It’s in the United Kingdom. Recently, her team cared for a seagull. “The loops of a face mask were bound around its legs,” Schwar says. The staff untangled the bird. It healed and was set free.

Do Your Part
PPE will be common until the pandemic ends. But there are steps you can take to reduce its environmental impact. 
Wear clean reusable masks. If you’re using a disposable one, Schwar suggests snipping the straps before throwing it out. This will prevent wildlife from getting tangled in them. Toss the mask in a garbage can with a secure lid. 
With adult permission, you can join cleanup events like Prinsloo’s. “My main goal is to constantly remove anything and everything I can off our beaches,” she says.

Many of the Southeast Iowa Union’s older readers don’t get their news online. Instead, they rely on the newspaper. Ashley Duong is a former reporter for the Union. She says national papers did not cover the pandemic in rural America very much. So “people appreciated the reporting we did,” she told TIME for Kids.
Yet local newsrooms are in trouble. Around 1,800 local newspapers have closed since 2004. That’s according to a PEN America report. They can’t compete with national news outlets. This is a problem for democracy.
Many communities do not have a trusted source for health or education news. And there isn’t much reporting about local government. Without that information, people are less likely to vote in local elections.
Many Americans still trust local news outlets. The Pew Research Center found that 46% of adults relied heavily on local coverage early in the pandemic.
It’s easy to see why. Ren Larson is a reporter for the Texas Tribune and ProPublica. “The media holds our elected officials and community leaders ,” she says.
Making a Change
Larson’s reporting has helped readers take action. She worked on a story for the Arizona Republic. It was about towns vulnerable to wildfire in 2019. It drew on data from communities across the western U.S. “People used that data to present to their local council about the hazards [in their area],” Larson says.
Local reporting is especially important in a pandemic. People need information about safety measures and vaccines.
Annika Hom writes for Mission Local. The news site covers the Mission District, in San Francisco, California. Its reporters questioned officials about how they were handling the neighborhood’s struggle with COVID-19. “Local journalism helps you get closer to the truth,” Hom says.
Larson agrees. “Local newsrooms have their finger on the pulse of what’s happening in a community,” she says. “They are essential to  a democracy.”

1. Can you tell me about Raya and the Last Dragon?
It’s a movie about friendship and learning how to trust. There are a lot of incredible characters, including Raya.
2. How do you feel your character, Raya, changes what it means to be a Disney princess?
People are going to see a lot of things they don’t expect from a Disney princess. Raya is a fighter. There are a lot of action sequences in this movie that people are going to get amped by. It’s really cool to see her and the martial arts that she is a master at.
3. What was your favorite part of acting in this movie?
My favorite part was getting to open the door to that world. I am such a huge fan of Disney animated movies. To be part of one feels crazy to me.
4. Why is representation important in movies?
It is really important to see yourself in stories. An entire team of people went to Southeast Asia to study the cultures there. They were able to bring back all of this incredible knowledge. All of that is seen in the movie. Disney has done an incredible job of making sure that the representation of that part of the world is accurate and true.
5. What do you hope people take away from this movie?
I hope that people will take away that the more we can get rid of our biases about what a certain type of person is like, the more we can work together toward a common good—and the better the world will be. That’s the message.

Amanda Gorman is the country’s first National Youth Poet Laureate.  She read her poem “The Hill We Climb” at the presidential inauguration. That was on January 20. Soon after, it was announced that she’d be reading at the Super Bowl. Former First Lady Michelle Obama (above) heard Gorman speak at the inauguration. Here, she interviews the 22-year-old poet.

I was moved as I watched you read your poem. How did you prepare yourself for that moment?
Everything was moving so quickly. I didn’t get to really sit down with the text until the night before. There was a lot of the night-before performing in the mirror.
You have a mantra you recite to yourself before performing. Can you share it?
It’s inspired by Lin-Manuel Miranda’s lyrics in Moana, in “Song of the Ancestors.” That song goes: “I’m the daughter of the village chief / We’re  from voyagers who made their way across the world.” Something like that. I wanted something that I could repeat because I get so terrified whenever I perform. So my mantra is: “I’m the daughter of Black writers who are descended from freedom fighters who broke their chains and changed the world. They call me.”
“The Hill We Climb” mentions your being a descendant of slaves. What role does poetry have to play in helping you make sense of our history?
Poetry is the lens we use to interrogate the history we stand on and the future we stand for. It’s no coincidence that at the base of the Statue of Liberty, there is a poem. Our instinct is to turn to poetry when we’re looking to communicate a spirit that is larger than ourselves.
What was your experience of the inauguration? Were you able to listen? Or were you just focused on what you came to do?
I was living in two spheres of my mind. There was the “Wow. Joe Biden’s speech was amazing. Lady Gaga just killed it.” But at the same time, 66% of my brain was dedicated to questions: “How am I going to get up to the podium without tripping? My hands are cold. Am I going to be able to flip these pages because my fingers are going numb?”
People know you as something of a —a poet who set the country on fire.
I want to highlight that this took a lifetime. Something I haven’t told anyone else is, for the past six years, whenever I’ve written a poem that I knew was going to be public or performed, I told myself, “Write the inauguration poem.” And what that meant for me is: Write a poem that is worthy of a new chapter in the country. Write something that is brave enough to be hopeful.
As you know, I have two daughters around your age. What does sisterhood mean to you and your twin?
As twins, we’re pretty dissimilar. But what bonds us isn’t our personalities. It’s our values. We’ve been raised like you, by a strong Black woman who taught us to value our ideas and our voices.
Do you have any advice for young girls who earn their way into the spotlight?
I would say to anyone who finds themselves suddenly visible and suddenly famous: Think about the big picture. You have to crown yourself with the belief that what I’m about and what I’m here for is way beyond this moment. I’m learning that I am not lightning that strikes once. I am the hurricane that comes every single year. And you can expect to see me again soon.

318,318,Ocean Commotion,"{'Environment', 'Science'}","
Sound pollution is making oceans noisier than ever. And it’s harming marine life. That’s according to a new article in the journal Science.
Researchers looked at thousands of studies on ocean sound and its effects on wildlife. They found that noise pollution has increased over the years. It’s making life hard for sea creatures. 
Sea animals depend on the ocean’s natural sounds to find their way around. They also use sound to communicate. “For fish, sound is probably a better way to sense their environment than light,” Francis Juanes says. He’s one of the article’s authors. But noise pollution drowns out natural sounds. It comes from activities like shipping, drilling, and construction. As animals flee noisy areas, their habitats shrink.
There are solutions, the study’s authors write. These include wind-powered ships and quieter propellers. And governments could pass laws limiting noise. “We have noise standards for cars and trucks,” says Carlos Duarte, the paper’s lead author. “Why should we not have them for ships?”
Stop and Think! Who are the people quoted in the article? What makes them experts on the subject? How do their statements help you to understand the topic?

Scientists have discovered what may be the smallest reptile on Earth. The species is called Brookesia nana, or nano-chameleon. It lives in the rainforest in northern Madagascar. The finding was published in the journal Scientific Reports.
Researchers found two of the chameleons, male and female. The male is less than an inch long and fits on a fingertip. The female is larger, at a little more than an inch long.
Chameleons are threatened by deforestation. That’s true of many rainforest species. But there is good news. Oliver Hawlitschek is a biologist at the Center of Natural History in Hamburg, Germany. He says the chameleon’s habitat has been placed under protection. “The species will survive,” he says.

321,321,Virus Detective,"{'Science', 'History'}","
The  coronavirus that causes COVID-19 was discovered in 2019. But a coronavirus had been discovered in humans long before that. In 1964, June Almeida identified the first coronavirus known to cause human disease.
Suzanne Slade is the author of the new picture book June Almeida, Virus Detective! It describes Almeida’s life and work. “She has made significant contributions to our understanding of coronavirus,” Slade told TIME for Kids. “Her work is helping to fight it today.”
Daring to Discover
Almeida was born on October 5, 1930, in Glasgow, Scotland. From an early age, she loved science. She hoped to attend college, but she couldn’t afford it. Instead, at 16, Almeida went to work. She started as a lab technician at a hospital near her home. At that job, she used a microscope to analyze cells from sick people. At another job, Almeida learned a technique called negative staining. It makes viruses easier to see under a microscope.
Well-known scientists, such as British  David Tyrrell, became aware of Almeida’s skills. He and his team of researchers couldn’t identify the virus that had given one boy a terrible cold. They asked for Almeida’s help. 
Almeida used her negative-staining skills to set the mysterious virus against a dark background. That helped her see it clearly. Next, she used a powerful microscope to take crisp photos of the virus. She noticed that each virus particle was surrounded by tiny dots. This made it look like a crown. The word corona means “crown” in Latin. So the virus was named coronavirus.

Almeida’s methods have helped researchers battle the virus that causes COVID-19. In addition to her coronavirus discovery, Almeida did important research on several other viruses. “No matter what challenges she faced, she was always learning about science,” Slade says. “She just kept working hard.”

Jiyoon Han’s family owns Bean & Bean Coffee Roasters, a chain of coffee shops in New York and New Jersey. Some of them were closed for months because of COVID-19. When they reopened, employees had a problem: They kept running out of coins. “Getting change was just not possible for weeks,” Han told TIME for Kids.
Other businesses have had this issue. Supermarkets are asking customers to pay electronically or with exact change. Until recently, banks were unable to order their usual supply of coins from the government. What’s going on?
Money Problems
There’s a coin shortage in the United States. In spring 2020, fewer coins were made at the U.S. Mint because of COVID-19 health restrictions. In June, the government limited the distribution of coins to banks. 
Karen Dynan teaches  at Harvard University, in Cambridge, Massachusetts. She has also worked for the U.S. Department of the Treasury. Dynan says there’s a bigger reason for the shortage. People aren’t going out and spending as much. “Coins have not disappeared,” she says. “They’re in people’s homes.”
In July, a U.S. Coin Task Force was created to fix the shortage. Things are beginning to improve. On January 13, the government said banks will no longer face limits on their coin orders. The coin shortage may soon be a thing of the past.
Do Coins Matter?
People aren’t using cash as much. Electronic payment has become more common. “We were already moving toward a cashless economy,” Dynan says. “The virus has just  all of that.”
Tae Kang owns the New Look Hand Car Wash. That’s in Rochelle Park, New Jersey. “We’ve noticed more people paying electronically,” he says.
So do we still need coins? For now, the answer is yes. Dynan has a suggestion to help end the shortage. You can make “a special trip” to exchange your coins for bills at a bank or spend them at a store.

Sprouting Wings
Sprouting Wings, by Louisa Jaggar and Shari Becker, tells the true story of James Herman Banning. He was a pilot who built his own plane. In 1932, Banning became the first Black pilot to fly across the United States. At the time, most pilots didn’t look like him. Jaggar told TIME for Kids that she hopes readers are inspired by his story. “Banning wasn’t afraid to have a really big dream,” she says. “For a crazy, really good dream to come true, [it takes] hard work, and you have to really want it.” —By Karena Phan 
Legacy 
Nikki Grimes grew up in Harlem, in New York City. She gave her first poetry reading at the Countee Cullen Library, which was named for a poet of the Harlem Renaissance.  That was a time in the 1920s and 1930s when Black art flourished in Harlem. “I grew up with the poetry of that era,” Grimes told TFK. “But I noticed how few of the Harlem Renaissance poets I came across were women. So I set out to find them.” The result is her new book: Legacy. It features these women’s poems. Their words are also used to create new poems. “I was able to build a bridge between the past and the present,” she says. —By Constance Gibbs
VIP: Lewis Latimer
Lewis Latimer was a Black inventor born in 1848. He’s best known for improving the lightbulb. His ideas made it more affordable. VIP: Lewis Latimer, by Denise Lewis Patrick, is about Latimer’s life and work. The book also explores the challenges faced by Black inventors. “Black men and women have been creating and making history for centuries,” Patrick told TFK. “It gives me a sense of pride to learn of the many ways African Americans, in particular, have contributed to our country. American history is all our history.” —By Rebecca Katzman

The Super Bowl is the National Football League’s championship game. It’s played each year on the first Sunday in February. The host stadium is usually packed with tens of thousands of fans. But this year’s game—between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, at the Raymond James Stadium, in Tampa, Florida—will be different.  
Due to the coronavirus pandemic, a limited number of spectators will be allowed to watch the game at the stadium. To honor the courageous heroes who have been working during the pandemic, the NFL has invited 7,500 vaccinated healthcare workers on an all-expenses-paid trip to attend the game. “These dedicated healthcare workers continue to put their own lives at risk to serve others,” NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said, in a statement. “We owe them our ongoing gratitude.” 
Even without a packed stadium, viewers can anticipate high levels of excitement. The big game will be broadcast on live TV. Millions of people will be watching. They’ll be able to enjoy the creative commercials aired during breaks in the action. Some longtime favorite ad characters might be missing, though. Many companies, including Coca-Cola, have put their ad funds toward causes that spread awareness of COVID-19.
The Kansas City Chiefs are competing in the Super Bowl for the second year in a row. They won last year’s game. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers will be making NFL history as the first team to play in a Super Bowl hosted at their home stadium. Additionally, all eyes are on the Buccaneers as they play under the leadership of legendary quarterback Tom Brady. Will the former New England star lead the Buccaneers to victory, as he did six times for the Patriots? Or will Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs take home the trophy again?
No matter the outcome, Super Bowl LV is sure to be remembered for years to come. So grab a bowl of chips and your favorite dipping sauce, and tune in this Sunday at 6:30 p.m. ET.

Here, TFK Kid Reporter Rory Hu shares her thoughts on When Life Gives You Mangos, by Kereen Getten. 

Clara Dee-Henson used to be a carefree girl living in a village called Sycamore on a tropical island. The village is like one big family, and she knows the place inside out. Clara has always spent her summer eating ripe mangos, surfing the waves, and hanging out with her best friend, Gaynah. 
Then Clara begins to suffer from memory loss. She’s unable to remember what happened last summer. Her world quickly changes, and she doesn’t understand why. Gaynah has started acting mean to her. Clara is now fearful of the ocean, which she once loved. And she discovers that the village is not as peaceful as it looks. In search of answers, she goes on a journey to understand her world and herself. 
When Life Gives You Mangos is a moving tale about friendship, family, and forgiveness. It’s a story that will make you smile while putting tears in your eyes. I recommend you read it at least twice, because you’ll have a completely different perspective once you know the ending.

Shortly after they move in with her, Lily notices that her Halmoni is behaving mysteriously. After looking around the house for clues, Lily discovers the reason: Years ago, Halmoni stole something from some magical tigers. Now they want it back.
Anyone who likes an adventure should read When You Trap a Tiger. The story line is gripping and keeps the reader entertained from beginning to the end.

At first, November 25 seemed like an ordinary day for Tyler Gordon. But that changed when the 14-year-old artist got an unexpected phone call. Who was it? Kamala Harris, who was then vice president-elect of the United States. 
Tyler had shared a video on Twitter that showed him painting a portrait of Harris. The video went viral. It caught Harris’s eye. She called Tyler to praise his work. “It’s a very special thing to be an artist like you are,” Harris told him. 
Tyler, who is from San Jose, in California’s Bay Area, has been painting since he was 10.
He was born deaf. At 5, he had surgery. It gave him some hearing. But he has been bullied at school because of a speech . Art enables him to move past these hardships. “My art gives me power to be myself,” Tyler says. 
Tyler’s talent has gotten people’s attention. He was chosen as a finalist for TIME’s 2020 Kid of the Year. Then TIME  Tyler to paint LeBron James. The resulting portrait appeared on the cover of the magazine. 

Tyler is known for painting portraits of people who inspire him. That’s why he painted Harris. He admires her ability to break barriers. She’s the first woman, the first Black person, and the first person of South Asian descent to become a U.S. vice president. 
After talking to Harris, Tyler painted another portrait. His subject was Joe Biden. Biden was then president-elect. Tyler looks up to Biden since Biden has struggled with a stutter, too. 
Tyler is now a TFK Kid Reporter. He shared a few words about Harris, Biden, and that exciting day in November. Read what he had to say below.
In His Own Words 
Getting a call from Kamala Harris was the most exciting thing that has ever happened to me. It was a typical day, and my mom and I were just sitting down and talking about painting. All of a sudden, her phone started ringing. The call was from a private number. She answered it, and we heard, “Hi, it’s Kamala Harris!”
My legs went weak and my hands started to sweat. I didn’t know what to do. My smile went from ear to ear, and I felt all warm inside. I couldn’t believe I was actually talking to Kamala Harris and that she had called me. She told me how proud she was of me and how much she loved the painting of her. She even said that when she comes to town, she wants to meet me! 

I’m so inspired by Kamala Harris. She has overcome so many obstacles in her life. She’s the first Black U.S. vice president and also the first female U.S. vice president. She’s from the Bay Area, and I know if she can come from here and do amazing things, then so can I. 
Joe Biden is inspirational to me too, because he has a stutter, just like me. He’s not embarrassed or afraid of what people think about the way he talks. He gives me the confidence to speak and not worry about what people think.

On January 20, Joe Biden was sworn in as the 46th president of the United States. Biden won the presidential election in November, defeating Donald Trump.
Biden took the oath of office at the U.S. Capitol, in Washington, D.C. He was sworn in by the chief justice of the Supreme Court, John Roberts. Biden pledged to “preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution.” 
In his inaugural address, President Biden called for unity. “On this January day, my whole soul is in this: bringing America together, uniting our people, and uniting our nation,” he said. Near the end of his speech, Biden held a moment of silence for the 400,000 Americans who have died from COVID-19. 
Kamala Harris was sworn in as U.S. vice president. She’s the first woman to hold this position. She’s also the first Black person and the first person of South Asian descent to do so. Harris was sworn in by Supreme Court justice Sonia Sotomayor. 
Making History
Inauguration Day 2021 was unique in several ways. Typically, many people travel to Washington, D.C., to witness a presidential inauguration. But because of the coronavirus pandemic, only a limited number of people were allowed to attend this one. Instead of a crowd, nearly 200,000 flags were planted on the National Mall. They stood for people who were unable to be there. 
Security was tight. About 25,000 members of the National Guard were on hand. Two weeks earlier, on January 6, a large group of Trump’s supporters violently stormed the Capitol. They were trying to stop the U.S. Congress from confirming Biden’s victory. 
Trump did not attend the Biden-Harris inauguration. He was the first outgoing president to skip an inauguration since Andrew Johnson, in 1869. Former presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush, and Bill Clinton were there. So was outgoing vice president Mike Pence. 
The ceremony featured the first National Youth Poet Laureate, Amanda Gorman. At 22, she is the youngest inaugural poet. Her poem captured the day’s theme. “There is always light, if only we’re brave enough to see it, if only we’re brave enough to be it,” she read. 
Day 1
After the inauguration, Biden and Harris quickly got to work. Harris gave the oath of office to three new senators. They are Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, of Georgia, and Alex Padilla, who replaces Harris as a California senator. 
At the White House, Biden signed 17 executive actions. One was a plan for distributing COVID-19 vaccines. Others, focusing on immigration and climate change, reverse orders made by Trump. “I’m going to start by keeping the promises I made to the American people,” Biden told reporters. 
Festivities continued in the evening. Harris gave a speech from the Lincoln Memorial. Echoing Biden’s message, she called on Americans to “believe in ourselves, believe in our country, believe in what we can do together.” Later, a fireworks display lit up the sky.

330,330,Should Cursive Be Taught In Schools?,"{'Debate', 'Opinion'}","
Even in the age of computer keyboards, the ability to write neatly on paper is important. Kids are taught to print their letters, or write each one separately. That looks like what you’re reading now. But what about cursive writing? Many schools no longer teach it. Some people think it’s a dated form of writing and that the time is better spent on other subjects. Others say learning cursive is useful. In 2019, Texas reintroduced cursive as an essential skill. Should cursive be taught in schools? We asked TIME for Kids readers to share their thoughts. Here’s what four of them had to say.
Yes

Jayita Iyengar, 12
East Rutherford, New Jersey
Putting pen to paper has benefits that typing can’t replace. Research shows that learning to write by hand is a key to good spelling and composition skills. Plus, cursive writing could be considered an art form all on its own. It’s one way for students to develop the side of their brain that isn’t developed by basic reading and writing skills. 
No

Keith N. Kerman, 10
Pelham, New York 
Cursive shouldn’t be taught in schools anymore. It’s hard to do, and it’s a waste of time. The letters are so complicated and fancy that practically nobody’s able to do it accurately. And with all of this technology around nowadays, such as computers and phones, why should cursive still exist? Besides, who cares about cursive?
Yes

Justin Lining, 9
Bellevue, Washington
Cursive looks more glamorous than printing. Its letter formation has extraordinary curves and arches. Some parts are wide, while some parts are narrow. That will naturally appeal to people’s eyes and impress people. You can write in cursive faster because you connect the words. Your pen doesn’t pause. Cursive can let your thoughts flow.
No

Spriha Pradeep, 10
Fremont, California
Learning cursive can take away time from subjects we use every day. Typing is increasingly important. Cursive writing is slower, harder to read, and harder to learn. Due to technology, cursive has become insignificant. We hardly use handwriting. There’s no reason to teach students a skill that they won’t use and will most likely forget.

This time of year, you might see lions roaming the streets. They prance to the beat of a drum.
They aren’t real lions: They’re dancers in colorful lion costumes. They’re celebrating a tradition that originated in China. It’s meant to bring good luck in the coming year. In many Asian countries, the new year is celebrated with the new moon that occurs in late January or early February. This year, the holiday begins on February 12. 
Typically, a lion is made up of two dancers. One dancer controls the head. The other controls the tail. There are different kinds of lion dances. The most spectacular might be jong, or pole, jumping (pictured above). The dance combines  skills and acrobatics. 
“I think of it as a sport,” says Anthony Huang, 15. He’s a dancer at the New York Chinese Freemasons Athletic Club. Anthony has performed as the lion’s tail. This is his first year controlling the head. It can weigh 20 pounds.
It’s important to Anthony to pass on this historical dance form. “This tradition really represents me,” he says. 
Changing Times
Lion dances were once performed mostly by males. These days, the activity is more .
LionDanceMe is a group in San Francisco, California. On its teams, boys and girls work together. Anyone can take up lion dancing, says team member Ananda Tang-Lee, 16. “You have to have confidence that you can do it,” she says.
During the pandemic, LionDanceMe has recorded performances to show online. The group is excited to perform in person again, when it’s safe. “It’s a different performance in real life,” says Isabella Yu, 16. She plays drums, cymbals, and gong. “We bring a lot more than just the performance. We bring energy and excitement, too.” 
Lion dancing will likely continue to evolve. But a team’s sense of community will never change. “We call it a family,” Ananda says. “It’s really great, because we always have each other’s backs.”

TFK Kid Reporter Sophia Hou spoke with Cynthia Leitich Smith, editor of the new book Ancestor Approved: Intertribal Stories for Kids. Here’s part of their conversation.
1. Tell me about the book.
Ancestor Approved is a collection of short stories and poetry. It’s set at a powwow for different tribes in Michigan. It features art and writing by a Native American illustrator and authors. 
2. How would you describe a powwow?
Powwows are cultural celebrations. They’re a lot about community—about people coming together. Powwows honor ancestors, elders, families, and rising young heroes who will take us into the future.
3. What inspired you to put together this collection of stories and poems?
I’m a member of the Muscogee Nation. When I was a young reader, there weren’t many books that featured Native heroes and modern-day stories. So I wanted to increase the availability of books about those subjects for kids who are interested. 
4. How can your anthology help readers understand Native American culture?
It gives Native Americans a look at people from tribes that are not like their own. So if you are an Ojibwe reader, you might learn something about the Cherokee. If you’re not Native, it offers a window into real-life three-dimensional kids from lots of different tribes and some of their cultural practices. But it also shows some of the ways in which they’re just like you. 
5. What do you want readers to take away from the book? 
I want them to celebrate heritage, elders, the power of friendship and family, and the importance of connecting with other people and lifting them up in a positive way.

I’d try to stop climate change by reducing pollution. I would limit the amount of single-use plastic being manufactured and used. I would also clean up the world’s oceans. —Sophia Hou, 11, Short Hills, New Jersey
I would go on national listening tours to meet with millions of Americans. I’d show them that I value their opinions, I understand their feelings, and I want to work with them to make America a better place. —Jeremy Liew, 12, Riverside, Connecticut
Good relationships with other countries are essential. I would meet with top world leaders and establish friendships. (And I’d paint the White House rose gold, my favorite color!) —Rory Hu, 10, Cupertino, California
The first thing I’d do is make a holiday honoring one of my heroes, Harriet Tubman. She risked her own life and safety to free people from slavery. —Victoria Hanson, 11, Chadds Ford Township, Pennsylvania
I know that student loans are a big worry for college graduates. I’d pardon student loans up to $10,000. —Pranav Mukhi, 10, South Setauket, New York

Unfortunately, I connected to the part in the book where a kid has money stolen from his pocket at summer art camp. Rondo says he took the cash to teach people that thieves are real! I have learned from experience that keeping money in short pockets or socks is an invitation for thieves. I would recommend this book to people who like dogs and mysteries.

337,337,Vaccine Trackers,"{'Transportation', 'Health'}","
The delivery truck snaked its way over Northern California’s highways. Analysts watched every detail of its trip. They saw the stops the driver took. They knew the weather. Most important, they knew the status of its precious cargo: thousands of doses of COVID-19 vaccine.
In the truck were boxes of vaccine in trays. Each tray held at least 975 doses. They were packed with dry ice, sensors, and tracking devices. In December, Pfizer was the first company to ship COVID-19 vaccines in the United States. Pfizer’s doses must be kept frozen at between -112°F and -76°F. That’s below normal freezer temperatures. (Your home freezer is about 0°F.)

The analysts saw a problem. Two of the trays were too cold. The driver was told not to deliver them. “They never left the truck,” Gustave Perna told reporters on December 16. He runs  for Operation Warp Speed. That’s the U.S. vaccine program. “We returned them immediately.”
Shipping millions of vials of vaccine is hard enough. Keeping them properly frozen is even harder. So the government, drugmakers, and delivery companies have worked together. They’ve made a network of monitoring devices and detection systems.
Helpful Technology
Every box of Pfizer’s vaccine has a GPS device. It also has a temperature monitor. And it has a bar code. The bar code is scanned once it reaches a destination. If the doses go to the wrong place, or if they get too hot or cold, officials are alerted. 

This information goes to the Vaccine Operations Center. That’s in Washington, D.C. Officials there watch over Operation Warp Speed. The team saw the temperature problem unfold in Northern California. Later, it saw the problem in Mobile, Alabama. “Same ,” Perna said.
This was one of the first delivery problems Perna’s team faced. It won’t be the last. But the technology meant to detect problems had worked. Replacement trays were sent to Alabama and California.
More On the Way
Another vaccine, made by the company Moderna, is now being distributed. It requires long-term storage and shipping at -4°F. That’s far less cold than the Pfizer vaccine requires. And more vaccines are nearing approval.

To keep track of it all, the government made new software. It’s called Tiberius. It lets state and federal agencies track their orders. They can follow their vaccines within the areas they serve. “They can dive in and really go into great detail on making decisions,” says Operation Warp Speed’s Deacon Maddox.
Operation Warp Speed hoped to vaccinate 20 million Americans against COVID-19 by the end of 2020. But only about 4½ million people had gotten a dose by January 4. That’s according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Former CDC director Dr. Tom Frieden spoke to TIME. He said the country “should be focusing on getting the vaccine out as rapidly, as widely, and as  as possible.”

The first people to get vaccinated have been healthcare workers and the elderly. But even with all the technology at work, a vaccine isn’t expected to be available to most Americans until at least spring.

338,338,New COVID-19 Challenges,"{'World', 'Health'}","
The COVID-19 pandemic rages on. More than 90 million cases have been detected worldwide. At press time, the United States had seen about 23 million cases. Three million new cases had already been reported in 2021. In California’s Los Angeles County, about 1 in 5 people is testing positive daily. 
Vaccine delivery is underway. (See “Vaccine Trackers.”) But it’s not going smoothly. And health officials are worried about new variants, or versions, of the virus that causes COVID-19.
New Variants
One new variant is more contagious than the original. But it doesn’t seem to cause worse symptoms. 
The variant was first found in the United Kingdom (U.K.) in September. It has now been detected in at least eight states in the U.S. “We’re likely to see this increase,” Greg Armstrong told the Washington Post. He works for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Other variants were found in Japan, Nigeria, and South Africa. Officials say COVID-19 vaccines should work against variants. Scientists are studying this. Dr. Anthony Fauci leads the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. “We are taking [these variants] seriously,” he told TIME.
Delivery Issues
Distribution of the vaccines began in the U.S. in December. The government hoped to vaccinate 20 million people by January. Only about 9 million have gotten a dose so far. 
Some areas are getting fewer doses than promised. Others are getting more. There are strict rules about who can be vaccinated first. So some doses aren’t being used. They’re going bad and being thrown out. 
It will take a long time to vaccinate everyone. So people should continue to be careful. They should wear masks. They should wash their hands and stay six feet away from others. Dr. Rick Malley works at Boston Children’s Hospital. He told TIME for Kids that these actions “are so important, and can really reduce the number of cases.”

339,339,TFK Explains: Trump's Impeachment,"{'United States', 'Government'}","
On January 13, the United States House of Representatives voted to impeach President Donald Trump.
What is impeachment?
If a United States president is suspected of committing “treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors,” the Constitution gives the House of Representatives the power to impeach the president, or charge him or her with a crime. 
Impeachment does not remove a president from office. That’s up to the U.S. Senate.
Why did the House impeach the president?
The House charged Trump with encouraging a violent uprising against the government. 
On January 6, a large group of Trump’s supporters violently stormed the U.S. Capitol building, in Washington, D.C. Members of Congress were meeting to officially confirm Joe Biden as the next president. 
At a rally earlier that day, Trump repeated false claims that the election had been stolen from him. There is no evidence of widespread election fraud.
On January 12, the House asked Vice President Mike Pence to remove Trump from office. The 25th Amendment to the Constitution gives him that power if he has the support of two-thirds of Congress. “I do not believe that such a course of action is in the best interest of our nation,” Pence wrote.
The next day, all House Democrats and 10 Republicans voted to impeach the president. The final count was 232–197. 
What happens next? 
The case will go to the Senate for a trial. The Senate will vote on whether or not to convict the president. The trial won’t begin before January 19. Joe Biden will be sworn in as president on January 20. 
Why did lawmakers impeach Trump when he is about to leave office? 
Lawmakers say the president must be held accountable for his actions. Even once Trump is no longer president, the Senate can convict him. It can also bar him from holding federal office again. 
Hasn’t Trump been impeached before? 
Yes. Trump was impeached by the House in 2019. The Senate voted against removing him from office. Trump is the first U.S. president to be impeached twice.

The moon’s Ocean of Storms is a dry open space. In 1967, the United States landed its Surveyor 3 spacecraft there. Two years later, the Apollo 12 crew arrived. The astronauts collected  samples to bring back to Earth.
It’s been quiet in the Ocean of Storms since then—until lately. On December 1, China’s Chang’e 5 spacecraft landed there. The craft returned to Earth two weeks later, making China the first country to bring back rocks and soil from the moon since 1976.
Geologists are eager to look at the lunar materials. Brad Jolliff is the director of the McDonnell Center for the Space Sciences, at Washington University, in St. Louis, Missouri. In an email to the Associated Press, he said, “These samples will be a treasure trove!”
Chang’e 5 Mission
The Chang’e 5 mission is the fifth in a lunar winning streak for China. In 2007 and 2010, Chang’e 1 and 2 orbited the moon. In 2013, Chang’e 3 landed there and sent forth a rover. And in 2019, Chang’e 4 did the same, becoming the first spacecraft to successfully land on the moon’s far side.
Chang’e 5 was a harder mission. It involved a  spacecraft that didn’t just land on the moon but lifted off from it, too. Launched on November 23, 2020, the craft entered lunar orbit on November 28.
One stage separated from the main body of the craft. It touched down on the moon. It collected nearly 4½ pounds of rocks and soil. Then it transferred them to another vehicle. That vehicle lifted off and  with the orbiting part of the spacecraft.
A reentry capsule brought the samples to Earth. It thumped down in China’s Inner Mongolia region on December 16, ending the successful mission.
Thomas Zurbuchen works for NASA. He tweeted his applause: “Congratulations to China on the successful landing of Chang’e 5.” Zurbuchen also expressed his hope that the lunar samples “could advance the international science community.”

Go to the window. Look outside. Are there clouds in the sky? How many? Are they puffy? Are they wispy? Are they blocking sunlight? Or are they letting it through?
NASA scientists are interested in your answers. They’re using the power of “citizen science” to gather information about clouds from people all over the world. Amateur scientists contribute to professional research by making  and sorting data.
DIY Research
Often, citizen scientists don’t need special training or equipment. It may not even matter where they live. Many participants are kids. 
“This is a , real way for young people to engage in science that is useful and important,” Darlene Cavalier says. She founded a website. It’s called SciStarter. It helps people find projects to participate in. 
For NASA’s GLOBE Observer program, volunteers submit cloud observations. Satellites photograph clouds from above. But volunteers study them from below. “By combining the two, we get a more complete picture,” says Jessica Taylor, of NASA. Researchers use the data to learn about climate change.
There are thousands of citizen science projects to choose from. You can measure light pollution, study the diet of ants, or locate bees. Sometimes, volunteers gather data from their own backyard. Other projects happen online. 
The COVID Effect
COVID-19 has halted or slowed some scientific research. Many scientists have not been able to travel to do their work. Citizen science helps fill in the gaps. Volunteers can submit data gathered wherever they live. 
With more people at home because of the pandemic, there are more volunteer scientists. In April, SciStarter saw five times more engagement than the year before. Cavalier hopes the increased interest continues.
“There are so many questions out there, and scientists do not yet have all the answers,” she says. “They need your help.”

Joe Gardner, voiced by Jamie Foxx in the new movie Soul, teaches middle school band. He’s also a jazz lover and a gifted piano player. Joe’s seeking success and the approval of his mother (Phylicia Rashad). One day, he gets a gig playing with his idol, saxophonist Dorothea Williams (Angela Bassett). He thinks he’s about to fulfill his purpose in life. 
Before that can happen, Joe falls down a manhole. Eventually, he finds himself in the Great Before. That’s where new souls are prepared for life. It’s also where Joe meets Soul Number 22 (Tina Fey). He’s assigned to help her find her spark. That’s the passion that motivates her. But 22 isn’t excited about anything until she begins to experience life for herself.

By guiding 22, Joe gains an appreciation for the little things that make life worth living. For example, 22 gets her spark from ordinary activities, like watching the sky. 
The characters in Soul are very relatable. Everyone has a spark. The movie suggests that part of the beauty of life is discovering your spark and helping others find theirs.  
Joe’s piano pieces, played by musician Jon Batiste, are a highlight of the film. The music is impressive and full of feeling. It’s easy to believe these tunes take Joe on a musical journey to another world. By hearing them, we’re transported too.
I give Soul a rating of 9 out of 10. The movie is thought-provoking and inspiring. As the characters learn from one another, the viewer is invited to examine his or her own life. 
You’ll want to watch this film again and again with those who know you best, so you can discuss your spark and why it makes you you.

344,344,Gathering Storms,"{'Environment', 'Weather'}","
In November, Hurricane Eta made landfall in Central America. It caused destruction from Panama to Florida. Two weeks later, Hurricane Iota arrived. It was more powerful. It rained on places that were already flooded. Juan Orlando Hernández is president of Honduras. He called Iota a “bomb” that would leave the region in tatters.
According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the 2020 Atlantic hurricane season was the most active on record. Iota was the 30th named storm to brew in the Atlantic since May. It was the 13th to become a full-blown hurricane. 

Scientists say climate change is to blame. They don’t know if it’s causing more storms. But data seems to show that it’s making storms stronger. 
James P. Kossin works for the NOAA. He says the increase in  is changing how storms behave. “These storms have a human fingerprint on them,” he told TIME for Kids.

Storm Science
A hurricane begins in the ocean. It draws its energy from ocean air. The planet’s oceans are warming. Warmer water provides a storm with more energy. That means higher winds. It also means heavier rain. (See “Hurricanes 101.”)
Increased energy is causing hurricanes to get stronger faster. In August, Laura changed from a tropical storm to a strong hurricane in about a day. It slammed into Texas and Louisiana. Winds reached 150 miles per hour (mph). Laura’s storm surge—a wall of ocean water mainly caused by wind—reached 17 feet in places.

Hurricanes are also sticking around longer. So they do more damage. Westerly winds constantly blow around the planet. But they are slowing because of rising temperatures. That causes slow-moving storms. Hurricane Harvey flooded parts of Texas in 2017. “That storm was devastating because it didn’t move,” Kossin says. “It just sat there.”
Protection Plans
Storms don’t affect everyone equally, Dereka Carroll-Smith says. She’s a scientist at the National Institute of Standards and Technology. She analyzes data on communities that are most affected by hurricanes. This helps cities plan ahead.

 Carroll-Smith says areas with a high number of elderly people who can’t easily leave may need one emergency plan. A different plan might be needed where many people live in mobile homes. Recently, evacuations were complicated by the pandemic. Shelters couldn’t hold the usual number of people because of social distancing. 
“Intense storms are going to be devastating to everyone,” Carroll-Smith says, “unless we make preparations now.”
According to Kossin, reducing greenhouse gases is the first step. “We can stop making it worse. Then we can [start] adapting to the new climate we’re in.”
Hurricanes 101
A hurricane is a mass of clouds and thunderstorms. It rotates around an “eye,” or center. Think of a hurricane as a giant engine. Warm, moist air is its fuel. There’s plenty of that in the Atlantic during hurricane season.
Winds must reach 74 mph before a tropical storm is called a hurricane. Then it is rated on a scale of 1 to 5. The rating depends on wind speed. A Category 5 storm churns at 157 mph or more. It can destroy homes. It can make an area unlivable for weeks or even months.

The Democratic Party will control both chambers of the United States Congress for the next two years. That is the result of two runoff elections for the U.S. Senate in Georgia. They took place on January 5.
Two Democrats were named winners on January 6: Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff. “We proved that with hope, hard work, and the people by our side, anything is possible,” Warnock said in a speech.  
Democrats already have a majority in the House of Representatives. Now the Senate will be split. It will have 50 Republicans and 50 Democrats. As vice president, Kamala Harris will be able to cast tiebreaking votes. She’s a Democrat. This will help Democratic president Joe Biden to move his policies forward. 
The elections were held because none of the candidates earned a majority of the votes in November’s general election. When this happens, Georgia law says the two candidates with the most votes must face off again.

Wyatt Baldwin has been playing rock, paper, scissors since he was a kid. The game helped him settle disagreements with his three older sisters. ""I never got the chance to pick what we watched on TV until I learned the sport of rock, paper, scissors,"" he told TIME for Kids. 
Baldwin is president of the World Rock Paper Scissors Association. He's played in and hosted competitions all around the globe. He once had a 43-game winning streak. The secret to his success? ""Look for patterns in either your opponent's moves or behavior,"" he says. As all serious rock, paper, scissors players know, there's more to the game than luck. 
Ready to Rock
People have been playing rock, paper, scissors for about 2,000 years. It's played everywhere. Some cultures use different hand symbols. But the idea is the same. You and an opponent each ""throw"" one of three hand symbols. You win, lose, or tie (see ""Who Wins?""). 

Many people think the game is all luck. Your  of winning seems about the same as your chances of losing. But the outcome of the game is not random. That's because human behavior isn't random. There are patterns in how people make decisions. 
A 2014 study at Zhejiang University, in China, looked at how people play rock, paper, scissors. It followed 360 students in a tournament. Researchers found two key patterns. Winners tended to repeat their winning hand symbols. Losers tended to go from rock to paper to scissors. 
Knowing the  of the game isn't a sure ticket to winning. But it can help. Ken ""Whitey"" Watson is one of the world's best rock, paper, scissors players. He says winning takes skill. ""You have to size up your opponent."" Luck and chance play a part, but ""you have to be prepared and have a strategy,"" he says. ""Part of my strategy is being confident."" 
According to Baldwin, ""practice, practice, practice"" is the key to success. ""You can try practicing against yourself in front of a mirror,"" he says. ""But for me, that always ended up in a tie.""

A large crowd of President Donald Trump’s supporters violently stormed the U.S. Capitol building in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday. Members of Congress were meeting to officially  confirm Joe Biden as the nation’s next president. This process is completed following every presidential election. It’s called certification. It’s usually uneventful. But Trump says that votes were counted that should not have been counted. There has been no evidence of widespread fraud. Courts have consistently rejected his claims. Yet Trump and many of his supporters believe that he won the election. 
Trump spoke at a rally near the White House on Wednesday morning. Tens of thousands of his supporters came to hear him speak. Trump repeated his false claim that the election was stolen from him. Then many of his supporters marched to Capitol Hill and up the steps of the Capitol. Videos show the mob pushing its way past Capitol Police and into the building. Members of Congress and Vice President Mike Pence were quickly moved to safety. The Capitol was locked down. Four people died in the attack. Many were injured, including 14 police officers. The situation is historic. The last time the Capitol was breached in this way was in 1814. 
On Wednesday, police and National Guard troops worked to get the situation under control. More than 50 people were arrested. Most of the crowd left the scene after local officials demanded that everyone clear the streets by 6 p.m. In a video message on Twitter, Trump asked  his supporters to go home. “You have to go home now,” he said. “We don’t want anybody hurt.” But he continued to claim that the election was unfair. He also continued to praise the crowd, telling his supporters, “We love you.”
Many world leaders spoke out against the violence. So did American leaders from both major political parties. They urged respect for America’s democratic processes and the peaceful transfer of power.
After the crowds were cleared and it was safe to reenter the Capitol, Congress got back to work. They completed the certification at around 4 a.m. and made Biden’s win official. He will be sworn in as president on January 20.

Are you a big sports fan? If so, chances are you’ve read articles by a sports journalist. The writer may have broken down a game or profiled one of your favorite athletes. 
Sean Gregory is a senior sports correspondent for TIME magazine. He told TIME for Kids that being a sportswriter involves more than just going to games. Like all good journalists, Gregory takes specific steps to write a story.  
First, he decides which people he wants to interview. Gregory says that getting several perspectives adds interesting layers to an article. That’s why he doesn’t talk to just athletes but also to coaches and spectators. 
Next, Gregory puts together a list of questions. He says the questions are intended to “ passionate answers.”

Sportswriters also need to understand data compiled by sports analysts. Sports analysts use statistics to predict trends. 
“Analytics has become a bigger part of my job,” Emily Kaplan says. She’s a hockey reporter for ESPN. Kaplan says that writing about hockey includes analyzing which players are most valuable. “The way that we  a lot of those things [is] through  and through math,” she says. 
A Pandemic at Play
The pandemic has changed how sports journalists work. Many sports were canceled in the spring. Some resumed over the summer and fall. As a safety measure, reporters are either not permitted to go to games or allowed only in small numbers. 
Gregory hasn’t been to a game in months. He speaks to players on Zoom calls. But he misses chatting with fans at events. Sometimes, “they say funny things that enliven stories,” he says.
For now, many sports journalists are busy writing articles that take place off the field, court, or rink. Kaplan wrote about how COVID-19 impacted the finances of National Hockey League owners. Gregory reported on how coronavirus shutdowns affect athletes’ mental health. “What this pandemic has taught all of us is that we just need to find ways to adapt,” Kaplan says.

British and Colombian archaeologists have discovered a large display of ancient rock art. It’s on cliff faces in the Colombian Amazon rainforest. The drawings were probably created 12,500 years ago. They provide further proof that the rainforest’s earliest inhabitants lived alongside Ice Age animals. The archaeologists made this discovery in 2019. But they kept it secret until now, ahead of the rock art’s debut in an upcoming documentary.

Without a doubt, 2020 has been a historic year. We have experienced a pandemic, massive wildfires, and the loss of iconic leaders. 
But the year has also moved people to show gratitude and stand up for what they believe in. There were public displays of thanks for medical staff and essential workers. We saw protests for racial justice. And there was record-breaking voter turnout in the United States presidential election. 
Here are some of 2020’s historic moments. Which will you always remember?

January 2: Parts of Australia declare a state of emergency as BUSHFIRES burn across the continent. It is one of Australia’s worst fire seasons on record. By the end of March, 47 million acres had burned. At least 30 people died. Some 3 billion animals were killed or displaced, according to the World Wildlife Fund.

February 2: Demarcus Robinson and Cameron Erving, of the Kansas City Chiefs, bask in their team’s SUPER BOWL LIV victory. The Chiefs beat the San Francisco 49ers 31–20. It is the team’s first title in 50 years. 

February 6: President Donald Trump holds a newspaper that says he has been acquitted, or cleared, of IMPEACHMENT CHARGES. The previous day, a majority in the U.S. Senate voted not to remove the president from office. He had been charged with abusing his power and obstructing justice. The charges were made by the U.S. House of Representatives.  It voted to impeach the president on December 18, 2019. 

March 11: The World Health Organization (WHO) declares the CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK a pandemic. WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus says COVID-19 is likely to spread to every country in the world. The virus was first detected in December 2019. It has been linked to a live-animal market in Wuhan, China. 

April 6: Children hold up signs expressing GRATITUDE to medical staff and essential workers outside a healthcare center in New York City. By this time, more than a million people worldwide have been infected with the novel coronavirus.

May 25: GEORGE FLOYD is killed by a police officer during an arrest in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The event spurs demonstrations across the country and around the world. People come together to protest the unjust treatment of Black people by law enforcement. Here, a memorial honors Floyd’s life. People leave flowers and messages near the location where he died. 

May 30: SpaceX launches the DEMO-2 mission to the International Space Station from Cape Canaveral, Florida. It’s the first time American astronauts are taken into orbit by a private company. And it’s the first time NASA astronauts have lifted off from U.S. soil since 2011.  

June 3: CYCLONE NISARGA strikes near Mumbai, India. It’s the strongest cyclone to affect the area in more than 100 years. Winds of up to 68 miles per hour bent trees. About 10,000 residents are forced to evacuate their homes. No deaths are reported.

Olympians will soon be dancing for gold medals. On December 7, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) announced that breaking will be included in the 2024 Olympics. The Games will take place in Paris, France. 
Breaking is also known as breakdancing. It began in New York City about 50 years ago. 
""It was always neighborhoods of kids just battling each other,"" Victor Montalvo told USA Today. He's a professional breakdancer. ""Now, it's big-stage competitions.""
Breaking isn't the only new Olympic sport. Skateboarding, sport climbing, and surfing will debut next summer in Tokyo, Japan. The 2020 Olympics were postponed because of the coronavirus pandemic. 
The IOC says the 2024 Olympics will be ""fit for a post-corona world."" There will be fewer athletes and events. There will also be gender equality. The same number of male and female athletes will participate in the Games. That's an Olympic first. And there will be 22 mixed-gender events.

There’s a new statue in Central Park, in New York City. It marks the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment to the United States Constitution. In 1920, that amendment gave women the right to vote. 
The monument features Sojourner Truth, Susan B. Anthony, and Elizabeth Cady Stanton. They fought for women’s voting rights­. 
Artist Meredith Bergmann created the sculpture. She wanted to show these women working toward a common goal. “They knew each other,” Bergmann says. “They worked on the same causes. They spoke at the same conventions.” Each is shown doing what she did best. “Truth is speaking, Anthony is organizing, and Stanton is writing,” Bergmann says. She calls these activities “the ingredients of activism.”
But the history behind the scene is complicated. And the statue invites a closer look at our country’s past. 
A Closer Look
Evette Dionne wrote Lifting as We Climb. It’s a book for young people about Black women in the  movement. Anthony and Stanton were white. Dionne says the women fought to end slavery. But they also worked with people who supported . Their decisions, Dionne says, “caused harm to Black people for generations.” 
Black people have long taken the lead in the civil rights movement. That’s why Truth was added to the statue. The original plan included only Anthony and Stanton. Bergmann says they should be honored even as we learn about their flaws. “The people we admire looked beyond their own life and tried to fight for great ideals,” she notes. 
Dionne says the statue is just a step toward learning more about history. She offers this advice: “I encourage kids to think, ‘When I am being told this history, who is missing? And how can I find out more about those people?’”

362,362,This Week in TFK History: Antibullying,"{'People', 'History'}","
Time flies! The first issue of TIME for Kids was published in September 1995. That means TFK is turning 25. To honor our 25th anniversary, we’re pulling TFK stories from the archives and highlighting them in this space. Each archival issue relates to something in the news today. We hope these stories provide background for the things you’ll read about.

For this week’s science story, TIME for Kids spoke with 9-year-old Kushagra Kumar. He’s taking part in a new program at his school called Learn Kind. It encourages students to explore kindness through the lens of science. Kids evaluate how doing good deeds makes them feel. For Kushagra, acts of kindness bring joy.
TFK has always cared about kindness. In our October 27, 2000, issue, we wrote about schools that were creating antibullying programs and interviewed students who were a part of them. One told TFK that he believed bullies could change. “I teased people all the time when I was in second grade,” he said. “But by third grade, I got my act together. I didn’t like making other people feel bad.”

363,363,Positively Happy,"{'The Human Body', 'Health'}","
One night, Christine Carter was sitting with her daughter in her lap. They were making a list: “Three Good Things of the Day.” Her daughter, who was braiding Carter’s hair, said, “Mom, this is going to be one of my three good things.”
Making a list was their way of reflecting on things they were grateful for. It’s a technique based in an area of research known as the science of happiness.
Carter is a sociologist at the University of California, Berkeley. She studies how schools and families can  positive emotions and help kids lead healthier lives. This has become especially important during the pandemic, which has made many kids feel isolated. “Most kids don’t know this, but they’re grieving,” Carter told TIME for Kids. “They’ve missed out on important events. Many have lost people in their lives.”
Finding the positive doesn’t mean never feeling sad. It means understanding that feeling sad is natural, and that it passes more quickly if we can notice the good things in life. “We can practice bringing happiness to ourselves,” Carter says. “It’s like putting money in the bank. We can be ready to cope with hard times in the future.”
How to Be Happy
A key step toward happiness is learning how to describe emotions, even negative ones. Feeling sad? It’s better to  the emotion than to ignore it. Ask yourself: “What do I feel? Where in my body do I feel it? What color or shape is it?”
Expressing gratitude is also important, Carter says. Let’s say you often bicker with a brother or sister. Reflect on why you’re grateful for that person. Remember the good times. This makes it likely you’ll get along better tomorrow.
But the surest way to happiness is kindness. Helping others gives life purpose, Carter says. Even more, “We feel a sense of connection and love,” she adds. “Our nervous system feels safe when we’re connected with other people.”
Take Care
Here are some things you can do every day to be happier.
Take deep belly breaths.Write down things you’re grateful for.Talk with a friend.Do something kind for someone.Exercise, eat well, and get enough sleep.

This year, TIME for Kids celebrates its 25th birthday. A lot has happened in the last quarter century. Presidents have been elected. Milestones have been reached. Tragedies have struck. People have come together to solve problems. The whole time, TFK has brought news of these events to kids. Take a look back at the past 25 years. Read about some newsworthy moments and how TFK covered them.

TFK was founded in 1995 by Claudia Wallis and Lisa Garcia Quiroz. The first cover showed a 2-year-old living in Bosnia during a war. Wallis was TFK's first top editor. ""We had this idea that kids knew about the world and had questions,"" she says. ""We could fill in some gaps and deal with serious topics.""

In 1996, a sheep named Dolly was born. Dolly's birth was a scientific breakthrough. She was the first clone of an adult mammal. That means she was an exact copy. In a TFK cover story, editor Martha Pickerill explained the complex science of cloning. ""It was a really cool thing to be able to tell kids this had happened in their lifetime,"" she says. 

TFK launched its Kid Reporter program in 2000. We began tapping kids from around the country to report on local and national news. Dina El Nabli worked on the program. ""We were able to get kids front-row seats, press passes, and access to all these historic events,"" she says. ""It was a really great opportunity to experience history firsthand through the eyes of kids.""

On September 11, 2001, terrorists attacked the United States. In New York City, two airplanes hit the World Trade Center. The attacks landed close to home for TFK, which is based in New York. TFK editor Nellie Gonzalez Cutler says the staff tried hard to create an issue about the September 11 attacks that would celebrate heroes. ""I remember looking at my local paper,"" Gonzalez Cutler says. ""There was a picture of the firefighters and police raising a flag in the rubble of the World Trade Center. I said, 'That's our cover.'""

In August 2005, Hurricane Katrina struck the southeastern U.S. The storm killed more than 1,800 people. New Orleans, Louisiana, was hit especially hard. In March 2006, TFK wrote about the first Mardi Gras celebration in that city following the hurricane.   

TFK writes an annual feature about the best inventions of the year. In 2007, one of them was the first iPhone. ""The iPhone is no ordinary gadget,"" TFK wrote. ""It's a handheld, do-it-all computer. IPhone users can use it to talk, hear music, watch video, and look things up on the Internet. No wonder so many people want one!""

In 2008, Barack Obama made history when he was elected the first Black president of the United States. TFK's Nellie Gonzalez Cutler remembers watching the Obama family greeting the crowd on election night. ""That was so exciting because our readers were of that age,"" she says of the Obamas' daughters, Sasha and Malia. They were 7 and 10.

TFK Kid Reporters have interviewed many celebrities over the years. Former TFK Kid Reporter Sarah Horbacewicz recalls being assigned a story about Justin Bieber in 2009. She hadn't heard of the young singer, who was just releasing his first single. ""I remember asking my mom if I was interviewing Justin 'Beaver' or 'Bieber,'"" she says. Bieber soon went on to superstardom.

In 2014, Malala Yousafzai became the youngest person to win a Nobel Peace Prize. Yousafzai is a champion of education rights for girls. That year, TFK readers voted for her as the TIME for Kids Person of the Year. Here is a photo of Yousafzai with former TFK Kid Reporter Mia Felt.

From 2015 to 2016, astronaut Scott Kelly spent a record-breaking year in space. TFK joined TIME in following his year aboard the International Space Station. One standout moment was when TFK hosted a live video session with Kelly and astronaut Kjell Lindgren aboard the ISS. New York City students got to ask the astronauts questions.

At a White House press briefing in May 2018, TFK Kid Reporter Benje Choucroun asked a question about gun violence in schools. ""Can you tell me what the administration has done and will do to prevent these senseless tragedies?"" White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders grew tearful as she answered Benje's question. Their exchange made headlines. ""That was exactly the power of TFK at its best,"" said editor in chief Andrea Delbanco. ""We let kids be the ones to decide what's important to them.""

In March 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak was declared a pandemic. For the first time, TFK was made by people working remotely. And the magazine began publishing only digitally. ""It was the first time in 25 years of TFK that we did not print a paper copy of the magazine,"" Delbanco says. ""It's something I'll never forget.""
Looking Ahead
What do you think the world will look like 25 years from now? TFK's Andrea Delbanco has a prediction. ""The way in which we'll deliver our content will be completely different,"" she says. ""But there's not a time in this world in which bringing kids into the conversation won't be important.""

365,365,Studying Kindness,"{'People', 'Science'}","
Imagine you’re part of an experiment. There are two groups. Members of the first group get $10 to spend as they wish. Members of the second group also get $10. But they must use it to help others. Which group would you rather be part of? Which would make you happier?
Researchers at Kindlab study the results of experiments like this. Kindlab is part of a group called Kindness.org. The Kindlab team is interested in the effect that helping others has on the person doing the helping.   
Kindlab’s goal is to use scientific data to spread good deeds around the world. Oliver Curry is a research director at Kindlab. “The more we understand why people are kind, the better we’ll be able to . . . make the world a kinder place,” Curry told TIME for Kids. 

Gathering Data
In 2018, Kindlab published a report called “Happy to Help?” The group analyzed 27 experiments by other researchers. The experiments compared how people felt when they helped others with how they felt when they didn’t. “What we found when we  the results is that helping does make you happy,” Curry says.

Anyone can help with the work Kindlab is doing. How? By becoming a volunteer scientist. Volunteers gather data for research projects. Kindlab has more than 400 volunteer scientists in 45 countries. Jaclyn Lindsey is Kindness.org’s chief executive and cofounder. “We’re committed to putting out content and programs that are ,” she says. Studying data helps the group make sure it can do that. 
Volunteer scientists helped Kindlab and Harvard University on a project. The project evaluated the costs—in terms of money, time, and effort—of a kind act. Then it looked at how much the act would benefit others. Volunteers filled out surveys to rate the cost and benefits of good deeds. Researchers analyzed the data. This helped them determine which deeds were most  (see “Good Deeds”). 
Kindlab will use the data to create a database. It will be the first database of recommended acts of kindness. It will help people make informed choices about their kind actions.
Engaging Students 
Kindness.org is also working to spread empathy in classrooms. This year, the group launched a program called Learn Kind in 741 classrooms worldwide. It encourages students to take a scientific approach to kindness. “We’re giving students a few ideas of kind acts to try and asking them to report back on the experience,” Curry says. 

Kushagra Kumar, 9, is from Houston, Texas. He has enjoyed being part of Learn Kind. For one activity, he was asked to find out whether quarantine would limit kindness. But he found that quarantine gave him more chances to help others. “I sent video messages to my grandma telling her that I love her,” Kushagra says. How did he feel after the call? “Happy!” 

Good Deeds
In May, Kindness.org published a report. It listed the most cost-effective acts of kindness during a pandemic. These actions can be taken while social-distancing or in quarantine. Volunteer scientists helped the group put the report together. They rated how much effort goes into a specific act. They also rated how beneficial the act is. The list shown here is from Kindness.org. It features the top-five easiest and most effective acts of kindness.
Say thank you to someone who made your meal possible.Cover your mouth when you cough.Be on time for video calls.Tell the people you love how you feel about them.Video call your parents or grandparents.
Correction: A previous version of this story incorrectly noted that the Learn Kind curriculum is in more than 450 schools worldwide. It is in 741 classrooms worldwide.

366,366,Kid of the Year Gitanjali Rao,"{'Young Game Changers', 'Community'}","
For months, we’ve been asking, “who will become Kid of the Year?” The answer was revealed on December 4 during a TV special on Nickelodeon. Out of more than 5,000 nominees, Gitanjali Rao won the top honor. Academy Award–winning actor and TIME contributing editor Angelina Jolie spoke to Gitanjali about her work.

“Observe, brainstorm, research, build, and communicate.” That’s what the brilliant young scientist Gitanjali Rao told me about her innovation process. She spoke over Zoom from her home, in Colorado, during a break in her virtual schooling. At 15 years old, Gitanjali has been selected as TIME’s first-ever Kid of the Year.
Gitanjali told me about her astonishing work using technology to tackle issues ranging from contaminated drinking water to cyberbullying. She also talked about her mission to create a global community of young innovators that can solve problems the world over. Even over video chat, Gitanjali’s brilliant mind and generous spirit shone through, along with her inspiring message to other young people: Don’t try to fix every problem, just focus on one that excites you. “If I can do it,” Gitanjali says, “anybody can do it.” —By Angelina Jolie


1. When did you know science was a passion of yours?
I feel like there wasn’t really one specific aha moment. I was always someone who wanted to put a smile on someone’s face. That was my everyday goal. And it soon turned into “How can we bring positivity and community to the place we live?” And then, when I was in second or third grade, I started thinking about “How can we use science and technology to create social change?”
2. One of your latest innovations helps prevent cyberbullying. Could you tell me about that?
Yeah, absolutely. It’s a service called Kindly—there’s an app and a Chrome extension. It is able to detect cyberbullying at an early stage, based on  technology.
3. It’s so exciting to have such a forward-thinking, young, and female, inventor. Does that affect you in any way?
There are so few women in science and tech. I don’t look like your typical scientist. My goal has really shifted from creating my own devices to solve the world’s problems to inspiring others to do the same. Because, from personal experience: It’s not easy when you don’t see anyone else like you. So I really want to put out that message that anyone can do it.
4. I know you have these “innovation sessions.” Tell me about those.
I just looked at what worked for me and decided to share it with everyone else. It started with a simple presentation. Now I’ve partnered with rural schools, girls in STEM organizations, museums all across the world, and bigger organizations, like the Royal Academy of Engineering in London, to run innovation workshops.
5. That’s insanely impressive. What are you doing now?
I’m currently working on an easy way to help detect  [biological]  in water—things like parasites.
6. Is the environment something that’s very much on your radar?
Our generation is facing so many problems that we’ve never seen before. But then at the same time, we’re facing old problems that still exist. More than anything right now, we need to find that one thing we’re passionate about and solve it. Everything makes a difference. Don’t feel pressured to come up with something big.
7. When you’re not doing all of these amazing things, what do you do that’s just a 15-year-old thing?
I bake. It’s not good, but it’s baking. And it’s science, too.
8. So the science of the kitchen is not your specialty? 
I guess not. To be fair, most of the time we don’t have eggs at home, or flour, so I have to go online and search “eggless, flourless, sugarless cookies.” I made bread recently and it was good, so I’m proud of myself.

TIME’s Kid of the Year honor recognizes young people who are making a positive impact in their community. Along with winner Gitanjali Rao, four honorees were selected with the help of a committee of influential kids. The committee included Dylan Gilmer (Tyler Perry’s Young Dillon), Chinguun Sergelen (All That), Little Chef Ivy (Master Chef Junior), Sky Katz (Raven’s Home), and TFK Kid Reporters Raunak Singh and Tiana Sirman. Read on to learn about the four incredible honorees.
Tyler Gordon
High school freshman Tyler Gordon (pictured above) was born deaf. When he was 5, surgery gave him some hearing, though he speaks with a stutter. In elementary school, he was bullied so much that he barely spoke at all. But at 10, Tyler found a voice in art.
He started painting portraits of people who inspired him. In 2018, his portrait of NBA star Kevin Durant went viral. The player’s mother offered to buy it. Other stars Tyler has painted and met include Kevin Hart and Jennifer Lopez. Tyler is now 14. This year, he won a Global Child Prodigy Award. From his home, in San Jose, California, he hosts a painting class on Instagram. He has more than 18,000 followers. Tyler says that he still gets bullied but that painting is a way to move past it. “It helps me take my mind somewhere else,” he says. He hopes he can show other kids how to use art to overcome challenges, as well. —By Olivia B. Waxman
Jordan Reeves

Having a limb difference has let Jordan Reeves envision a more accessible world. Jordan, 14, is from Columbia, Missouri. She was born with a left arm that stopped growing below the elbow. That physical difference ignited her passion for design. Jordan believes design can empower kids with disabilities. That’s why she and her mother cofounded Born Just Right. It provides design and STEM resources for kids with physical differences. This way, they can come up with their own solutions.
“Kids with disabilities have a different point of view on the world, because the world isn’t made for us,” Jordan says. “We have this great design mindset because we grow up problem-solving.” Over the summer, Jordan was one of 30 people honored for the anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act. Next, she and Microsoft will design a guitar that people with physical challenges can play. —By Cady Lang
Bellen Woodard

Bellen, 10, is on a mission for inclusion. She has created a line of crayons in tones that reflect the wide spectrum of skin colors she sees in the world. A fifth grader from Leesburg, Virginia, Bellen is known as the world’s first crayon activist. With the support of her parents, she launched More than Peach in spring 2019. The nonprofit donates Palette Packets of multicultural crayons and sketchbooks to kids.
The idea came when one of Bellen’s classmates asked her for a “skin color” crayon. Bellen was the only Black girl in her grade. She knew the classmate meant the peach-colored crayon. “The peach crayon is a skin color,” she says. “But is it the only one? No, it isn’t. So I decided to make different shades of peaches and browns, and hopefully that could match everyone, including me and my friends and my classmates. Just everyone.”—By Jasmine Aguilera
Ian McKenna

Ian was in third grade when he learned that some kids at his school, in Austin, Texas, weren’t getting enough to eat at home. He wanted to help. For years, he had gardened with his mom. “I thought, ‘I’m good at gardening,’” says Ian, now 16. “Maybe I could try to start a garden that’s meant solely to help feed these people who are in need.” Ian persuaded his school to set aside space for a garden. He asked the community for donations of seeds and equipment. Other students donated their time.
Seven years later, Ian’s Giving Garden project has expanded to five schools. It has provided more than 20,000 pounds of organic produce to Austin families and food pantries. When COVID-19 hit, Ian began cooking meals for the hungry. He started offering online tutorials, a gardening hotline, and virtual cooking classes. “Hunger doesn’t stop,” he says. “I won’t stop until it does.” —By Aryn Baker

368,368,Vaccine Update,"{'Government', 'Health'}","
The drug company Moderna has asked the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for emergency approval of its COVID-19 vaccine. It made the request on November 30. If the FDA agrees, enough vaccine for millions of Americans could be ready by the end of the year.
Emergency approval means a drug can be used before testing is complete. Moderna is the second company to ask for it. Pfizer was the first. It made its request on November 20. Its vaccine was approved in the United Kingdom on December 2.
Cases of COVID-19 are on the rise in the U.S. Recently, there have been more than 160,000 new cases per day. Daily, there have been more than 1,400 deaths. Officials say the numbers could be even higher in the coming weeks. At press time, the novel coronavirus had infected nearly 14 million people in the U.S. More than 268,000 had died. Worldwide, 63 million people had caught the virus. Nearly 1½ million had died.

The FDA must decide if Moderna’s vaccine works and is safe. A late phase of vaccine trials began in July. The trials involved 30,000 people. Moderna says its drug is about 94% effective at preventing COVID-19. And it is 100% effective at preventing severe cases of the disease, the company says.
With FDA approval, Moderna says it could have 20 million doses ready for Americans by late December. That’s enough for 10 million people. Each person will need two doses. The first to be vaccinated will be healthcare workers and the elderly. Pfizer expects to have enough doses for more than 12 million Americans. It will be at least spring before any vaccine reaches the general U.S. population.
Stop and Think! How does the author use data to tell this story? What does data tell us about the COVID-19 vaccine and why it is needed? Which numbers stand out to you, and why?

370,370,At the Movies: The Croods: A New Age,"{'Movies and Television', 'Time Off'}","
The Croods: A New Age is a fun animated comedy for kids of all ages. It’s about relationships between two prehistoric families, the Croods and the Bettermans. 
The Croods live in a cave where they sleep together in piles. The Betterman family is more advanced. They have a house, separate rooms, modern clothing, and showers. When the two families meet, there’s plenty of adventure and conflict. There’s also a lot of love. 
Characters like Eep (a Crood) and Dawn (a Betterman) are easy to relate to because they’re happy to become friends. It’s the same as at my school, where the girls get really excited when they make new friends. And Gran, the Crood grandmother, is like a lot of grandparents, because she’s always telling funny stories about her childhood. My favorite part of the movie is when the character Thunk watches nature through a window. It’s his prehistoric television.
Kids will like The Croods because it’s funny and fast-paced. Parents will like it because it’s a good family movie. There’s even a new version of an old tune, “I Think I Love You,” for them to enjoy. 
I would rate The Croods an 8 out of 10. The only thing I didn’t like was that the characters are not diverse. And the story was a little predictable, but it was still interesting. The animation was really good and so was the theme of girl power. 
The Croods: A New Age was released on November 25.

There's also Playmobil's Large Hospital play set, which introduces kids to what goes on inside a hospital. Other top toys of the year are an escape. They involve drawing with chocolate, creating bright creatures and training a robotic balloon dog to do tricks. Here, the editors of TIME for Kids round up the best of this year's toys.
Inflate, Fido

Have you been begging your parents for a puppy during the pandemic? Squeakee the Balloon Dog, by Moose Toys, might be the next-best thing. With his squeaker toy, you can train him to do tricks. He sits, stands, and pees. He also responds to touch and voice commands. Pop him with his plastic pin, and he'll deflate to the ground. But have no fear: Squeakee can be reinflated with his plastic pump. He may not be a real dog or even a real balloon dog, but he acts like both.
Playing Politics

With these toys, you'll be playing politics long after the 2020 election. Hasbro's Monopoly House Divided is based on the classic version of the game. Instead of building hotels, you build campaign headquarters and win states. The White House is the ultimate prize. There's also Lego Architecture: The White House. With this building-block set, families can work together to recreate the historic home of the U.S. president. The set comes complete with gardens and a fountain!
Bright Ideas

Creatto Light Up Crafting Kit comes with tiles, connectors, lights and instructions for building a variety of whimsical creatures. With Shimmer Shark & Ocean Pals, you can create a shark, octopus, seagull or fish--or something of your own. Once the pieces are assembled, LED lights can be strung through the puzzle to illuminate the creature, perfect for brightening up a kid's bedroom. Thames & Kosmos offers several Creatto sets, including Magical Moose & Forest Friends and Sparkle Unicorn & Friends. 
Colorful Creations

Leave the clay out for 24 to 48 hours to dry, and your creation will turn into a soft sculpture. 
A Handy Robot

Need an extra hand? Try a robotic one that can help with everyday tasks. Mega Cyborg Hand, by Thames & Kosmos, comes with more than 200 pieces. A step-by-step manual shows you how to build it.

Once assembled, it slips on like a glove. 
Back to the Classics

This year marks the 60th anniversary of Etch a Sketch, and next year is the 50th anniversary of Uno. Celebrate these milestones with new twists on these timeless classics. Spin Master's Etch a Sketch Revolution is built for sketching perfect circles. Mattel's Uno Showdown makes quick reflexes a necessity of the popular matching card game.

Wooden Wonders

These low-tech kits combine the fundamentals of STEM and the arts. The Smartivity Music Machine is a do-it-yourself creativity kit. It lets you build a self-playing xylophone machine without glue or tools. Once the instrument is put together, you can crank out your own songs. The Smartivity Kaleidoscope is another wooden construction kit. This one focuses on patterns and colors. When the kaleidoscope is completed, it can be filled with beads or other small items from around the house. 
The Force Awakens

Many would agree that the real star of The Mandalorian is actually the Child. The creature is also known as Baby Yoda because it looks like the classic Star Wars character. Now, the creature can waddle its way into your home. Hasbro's Star Wars: The Child Animatronic Edition toy is cuddly. It blinks and makes adorable sounds. Mattel's The Child: Real Moves Plush has a remote control and can move across the floor. For kids who like to build things, Lego Star Wars: The Child might be the best choice. Sit down with the family and assemble the cutest kid in the galaxy. 
Challenge Accepted

Family game night just got a lot more active. Hands Full, by WowWee, is best described as Twister-meets--Bop It. It consists of tying yourself up in knots and responding to commands. Grab, jump, high-five, twist, and more. But don't mess up or the game is over! Vango's The #UpsideDownChallenge Game will turn your world upside down--literally. Sure, you know how to high-five a friend, draw a tree, and pour water from one cup to another. But what happens when you try to complete these tasks wearing upside-down goggles? 
Children's Hospital

Playmobil's Large Hospital brings the medical world to life. It's two stories high  and has rolling hospital beds, an elevator, and an operating room.

They will take office at an important moment in U.S. history. Biden and Harris must confront the COVID-19 pandemic. And they must work to bring together a divided nation. In his speech on November 7, Biden said, ""This is the time to heal in America."" Read on to learn how their lives and careers prepared them to lead the country. 
A Life of Service
""I pledge to be a president who seeks not to divide but unify,"" Joe Biden said in his victory speech on November 7. It may be his biggest challenge in nearly 50 years of public service.

In 1977, Biden married Jill Jacobs, a teacher. In the Senate, Biden focused on foreign . He would serve for 36 years.  

The 2020 presidential race was not Biden's first. He ran in 1988 and 2008. He was not successful. In 2008, Barack Obama became the Democratic presidential nominee. He asked Biden to run as vice president. Once in office, Obama trusted Biden with important tasks. These included foreign relations. 
Biden has long been known to work with politicians from both parties. On November 7, he promised to do so as president. ""I will work as hard for those who didn't vote for me as I will for those who did,"" he said. 
Breaking Barriers
Kamala Harris made history on November 7. She became the first woman to be elected vice president of the United States. She will also be the first Black person and the first person of South Asian descent to hold that office.

Harris has been a  throughout her career. She entered public office in 2004. She was district attorney in San Francisco, California. In 2011, she became the state's attorney general. She was the first woman and the first Black person to hold either position. 

In 2016, Harris was elected as a U.S. senator for California. She became known for asking tough questions of government officials. In 2019, she ran for the Democratic presidential nomination. Biden won that nomination. He asked Harris to be his running mate. 
On November 7, Harris gave her victory speech. ""While I may be the first woman in this office, I will not be the last,"" she said. ""Because every little girl watching tonight sees that this is a country of possibilities.""

Kamala Harris has made history. She’s the first woman and the first person of color to be elected vice president of the United States. Harris isn’t the only person breaking barriers in the 2020 election. A diverse group of leaders was elected to Congress by the highest number of voters in U.S. history. Here are a few examples of why this election is one for the record books.
Historic Firsts

Record-Breaking Numbers
6 Native members—five Native Americans and one Native Hawaiian—were elected to the House of Representatives.
138 women will serve in the 117th Congress, as of press time. This includes 104 Democrats and 34 Republicans.

375,375,Biden Elected President,"{'Government', 'Election 2020'}","
TIME for Kids reports on the results of the 2020 presidential election.
Former vice president Joe Biden has won the presidential election. He will become the 46th president of the United States. His running mate was Kamala Harris. She will become vice president. The two will be sworn in on Inauguration Day. That’s January 20, 2021.
The Associated Press announced Biden’s win on November 7. It was four days after Election Day. Biden was named the winner after taking Pennsylvania. That pushed his total number of electoral votes over 270. A presidential candidate needs at least 270 electoral votes to win. There are 538 in total.
Then Biden won Nevada. That took his number of electoral votes to 290. After winning Alaska on November 11, President Donald Trump had 217 electoral votes.
At press time, a winner hadn’t been announced in two states. One was Georgia. The other was North Carolina. These states don’t have enough electoral votes to change the outcome.
Biden has won the popular vote, too. As of November 12, he had about 77 million votes. Trump had about 72 million.
“America, I’m honored that you have chosen me to lead our great country,” Biden wrote on Twitter on November 7. “I will be a President for all Americans—whether you voted for me or not. I will keep the faith that you have placed in me.”
At press time, Trump had not conceded the election. He said he would challenge the results in court. Throughout the election, Trump voiced doubt about the country’s mail-in voting system. But there’s been no evidence of any widespread problem.
People voted in record numbers. The percentage of eligible voters who cast a ballot was the highest it has been since 1900. In some states, the candidates’ vote tallies weren’t far apart. Recounts are expected. Georgia has said it will recount its ballots. Trump’s campaign has said it will ask for another count in Wisconsin. States should complete recounts by December 8. That’s according to electoral college rules.

When Za’nia was a baby, she lived in a homeless shelter with her grandmother. At 9, she gave money to a family asking for help outside a supermarket in her hometown of Charlotte, North Carolina. She realized she wanted to do more for people in need. So she started the Z Feeds Angel Food Project with her church. 
She collected donations of food and toiletries from supermarkets, doctors’ offices, and shops, and gave them out in “go-go” bags. She took bags to the shelter where she had lived. “Everyone was so excited,” says Za’nia, now 13. During the pandemic, she has been packing go-go bags for people affected by closings of schools and shelters.

378,378,Do We Still Need Movie Theaters?,"{'Business', 'Debate'}","
On October 5, Regal announced plans to temporarily close all of its theaters in the United States. Because of the coronavirus pandemic and a surge in home-streaming, many people are no longer going out to see movies. Instead, they’re watching films at home. Some Hollywood studios have even premiered major pictures, such as Disney’s live-action Mulan, on streaming services.
Movie theaters are fun. But do we still need them? We asked TIME for Kids readers to weigh in on the question. Get your popcorn ready as you read what four of them had to say.
YES!
Ava Jung, 8
Paramus, New Jersey

There’s a difference between going to a movie theater and watching a movie at home. When people go to a theater, they can enjoy the movie without getting distracted by anything that they have to do at home. If theaters stay open, they can hire more people. Then new workers can earn money and buy stuff. That would help the economy recover. 
NO!
Zachary Haubenstock, 10 
San Diego, California 

It’s excessive to pay to watch a movie on a big screen with a bunch of people, especially during the pandemic. You can watch a movie in the comfort of your home. You can wear your PJs. You can even have an outdoor movie night with friends and practice social distancing. Even without COVID-19, theaters just won’t make it due to evolving technology.
YES!
Finnian Rawsthorne, 11 
Grand Blanc, Michigan 

You might have forgotten how much fun it is, but when the pandemic ends, you’ll want to go to the movies. They have slushies, candy, and gigantic screens. They have nice chairs with cup holders. And you don’t have to clean up! Just because you can live without them doesn’t mean that you’d want to. If you had the chance to go to a movie theater and there was no COVID, wouldn’t you go?
NO!
Camille Chien, 10 
Sunnyvale, California

I like watching movies at home. I can watch lots of different movies from different cultures. Also, some movie theaters are filthy. Most people take their snacks into the theater to eat and watch at the same time. What if you eat and then touch some part of your chair, then continue eating? The germs on the chair could get into your mouth. That’s not good!

As a kid, Victor Escandell enjoyed mysteries and detective stories. He also loved riddles, even though he often couldn’t solve them. “I’ve never been very good at logic exercises,” the artist told TIME for Kids. “I prefer using my imagination.” 
In Sleuth & Solve: History, Escandell uses his imagination to put a creative spin on classic riddles. The book is a collection of 20 illustrated stories. Each includes a mind-bending  mystery for readers to solve.  To create the puzzles, Escandell worked with writer Ana Gallo. Escandell’s detailed drawings set the scene and provide clues. 
The book is also a history lesson. Each story is set in a different place and time, from the Aztec empire to the Italian Renaissance. “I think the book is a great example of learning while playing,” Escandell says. 
Escandell shared a story from Sleuth & Solve: History with TFK readers. Can you solve the riddle?

380,380,Biden Wins,"{'Government', 'Election 2020'}","
Former vice president Joe Biden has won the 2020 presidential election. He will become the 46th President of the United States.
On November 7, four days after Election Day, the Associated Press announced that Biden had enough electoral college votes to win the presidency. His running mate, Kamala Harris, will become the vice president. She will be the first woman vice president. She will also be the first Black person and the first South Asian person to hold the job. 
Officials in several states had been counting votes in the close race. Biden was named the projected winner when he won the state of Pennsylvania. This brought Biden’s total number of electoral votes to 284. President Donald Trump had 214. A candidate needs at least 270 out of 538 electoral votes to win. 
Biden appears to have won the popular vote, too. As of November 7 at 11:50 a.m., the popular vote count stands at 74,847,834 votes for Biden and 70,591,531 votes for Trump. 
“America, I’m honored that you have chosen me to lead our great country,” Biden said on Twitter on Saturday. “The work ahead of us will be hard, but I promise you this: I will be a President for all Americans—whether you voted for me or not. I will keep the faith that you have placed in me.”

382,382,What Made the 2020 Election Different?,"{'Government', 'Election 2020'}","
President Trump and Joe Biden have sharply different ideas about how to lead the country. And voters had sharply divided opinions about the candidates. So Americans were eager to vote in the 2020 presidential election. They showed it by voting in record numbers. The percentage of eligible voters who cast a ballot was the highest since 1900. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, many voted early, in person. Others voted early using mail-in and absentee ballots. They took these steps to avoid crowded polling places on Election Day.
Even before the polls opened on November 3, a record-breaking 103.2 million people had voted. This was 74.3% of the total voter  in the 2016 election.

385,385,Who Declares the Winner?,"{'Government', 'Election 2020'}","
On Election Day, presidential candidates often express confidence that they’ll win the race. They sometimes do this while votes are still being counted. But it’s not up to a candidate to declare a winner. Nor is it up to his or her campaign or political party.
The winner and loser of a presidential race is not official until every state’s votes are counted and certified by state election officials. That can take days or weeks after an election is held.
Yet in many cases, newsrooms announce a winner in a state based on partial counts. Say candidate A is far ahead in a given state. A newsroom can decide that candidate B cannot catch up, even if he or she gets all the remaining uncounted votes. Candidate A can be declared the winner. This is an unofficial result, but it’s usually accurate.
Many news outlets, including TIME for Kids, rely on the Associated Press for election results. That’s because the AP does careful research and analysis before calling an election. It has reporters in every state who consult with election officials and check election websites. In 2016, the AP projection was accurate in every state where it declared a winner.

No winner has yet been declared in the 2020 presidential election. This year, because of the coronavirus pandemic, about three out of every four registered voters had the option to vote by mail. So millions of mail-in and absentee ballots are still being counted. 
Election experts say it’s important to be patient while waiting for the official vote count. They say it could be days, or even weeks, before Americans know the outcome of the election. 
A United States presidential candidate needs 270 out of 538 electoral votes to win.

She’s even persuaded many school districts, including her own, to remove plastic straws from their cafeterias. 
Chloe Mei’s interest in protecting the oceans and marine life comes, in part, from her love of scuba diving. “I want to keep the ocean clean and healthy for not only our generation,” she says, “but for many generations to come.”

390,390,A Closer Look,"{'People', 'Media Literacy'}","
When you think of a journalist, do you see a reporter with a pen and paper? Writing is one way to tell a story. But some stories are told without words.
Photojournalists are reporters too. They use a camera to capture a story in photos. You can see their work in the pictures that appear with an article. Their photos show readers the people and places being described. Photojournalists also create photo essays. Photo essays tell a story with few or no words.
Meet Alice Aedy
Alice Aedy is a photojournalist and filmmaker. She’s based in London, England. Aedy reports on stories about social justice and human rights. She also covers environmental issues. Aedy told TIME for Kids that she’s “passionate about climate change” because of how it affects people’s lives.
Photojournalism helps people understand current events. Photojournalists aren’t just photographers. They’re storytellers. They need to be on the scene and talk to people about what’s going on. Aedy has traveled the world to do her reporting. She spends as much time as she can in the country where a story is taking place. “I want my photos to build empathy,” she says, “and make people care.”
A Critical Eye
Aedy says that photography should be viewed “with a  eye.” Viewers should ask themselves questions like, “When, where, and why was it taken?” and “Was the photo taken with the permission of its subjects?”
It’s also important for viewers to think about how a photograph makes them feel. “We’re bombarded with images every single day,” Aedy says. “So my hope is that whatever you’re looking at, you just truly  with it.”

392,392,The Final Debate,"{'Government', 'Election 2020'}","
On Thursday night, President Donald Trump and former vice president Joe Biden met for this election’s second and final presidential debate. The debate took place at Belmont University, in Nashville, Tennessee. The moderator was Kristen Welker of NBC News. For more than 90 minutes, the candidates spoke about how they would address key issues facing the country. These included climate change, racism, the economy, and healthcare.
This debate was calmer than the first one between the candidates, on September 29. Trump and Biden spent that meeting speaking over each other. That made it hard to follow what was being said. New rules were put in place for Thursday’s debate. At some moments, one candidate’s microphone was turned off while the other person was speaking.
Welker’s first question was about the coronavirus pandemic. Biden pointed out that there are 70,000 new COVID-19 cases every day. “I will end this,” he said about the pandemic. “I will make sure we have a plan.” The president spoke about vaccine development. “It will be by the end of the year . . . I think it has a good chance,” he said.

Welker’s final question was about leadership. Each candidate took the opportunity to make his final pitch.
President Trump promised to rebuild the economy. “We have to make our country totally successful,” he said. “Success is going to bring us together.”
Biden said, “What is on the ballot here is the character of this country. Decency, honor, respect, treating people with dignity.”
Election Day is November 3. Voter enthusiasm is high. The United States Elections Project released new data this morning. At that point, 50 million people had voted early, at polling sites or by mail.

393,393,Seaweed Solution,"{'Environment', 'World'}","
Welcome to Bamfield. It’s a coastal village in British Columbia, Canada. Louis Druehl is steering The Kelp Express along the shore. For 51 years, the boat has taken him to Kelp Bay. There, ropes of seaweed grow beneath the water’s surface.

Druehl, 84, is known as the Kelp Grandfather. He began farming kelp, a brown seaweed, in 1982. Since then, he’s studied it. He’s cooked it. He’s even written a book about it.
Over the years, Druehl has seen interest in seaweed rise and fall. But as  affects the planet, the world is turning to seaweed as a possible solution. “People have discovered seaweed,” he told TIME. “They’ve discovered us.”

Super Seaweed
Seaweed can play a huge role in fighting climate change. It is used to create natural fuel and renewable plastics. It helps marine . And it absorbs carbon in the environment.
Some researchers say seaweed is a better climate-change solution than forests (see “Not Perfect”). Seaweed doesn’t need fertilizers, fresh water, or land. And it grows fast. Katie Lebling is with the World Resources Institute. “When we’re planting trees, we need to make sure it does not take away that land from food production,” she says. “That is not an issue with seaweed.”

Seaweed could become a global food source. Many worry about the environmental impact of eating meat. Could seaweed provide protein for the world? Carlos Duarte, a professor of ecology, thinks so. “To feed the world population by 2050, in a way that doesn’t harm the environment, there is only one pathway,” he says. “Seaweed farming.”
New Opportunities
Global seaweed production has doubled in the past decade or so. Interest in seaweed as a food source and climate-change solution is booming. In British Columbia, this means job opportunities, including work for people from First Nations communities. They are among the indigenous, or native, people of Canada. Many have left the area to find work. “We want people to have a job, so that they can come home,” Larry Johnson says. He’s president of a group that works with First Nations communities.
For thousands of years, First Nations people have farmed on land and in the ocean. “Seaweed farming . . . helps us create economies of our own that  with our traditions,” Johnson says. “Our role has always been to connect with the land.”

A seaweed industry could bring jobs to many people, such as those who lost work in the pandemic. Druehl’s daughter is one. He wants her to come work in Kelp Bay. But even if she won’t, lots of people are waiting to learn from the Kelp Grandfather.
Not Perfect
Seaweed might fight climate change. But there are risks. If it isn’t harvested, it can rot and release carbon back into the water or air. Growing too much could also affect how much light reaches species living deeper in the water. That would be dangerous for underwater ecosystems.
Halley Froehlich works at the University of California, Santa Barbara. She says seaweed “can be a part of the solution” to climate change, but it’s not a perfect solution on its own.

394,394,Early Voters,"{'Government', 'Election 2020'}","
Election Day is November 3. Americans will go to the polls to vote for president of the United States. But millions have already cast their ballot. As of October 19, 29 million Americans had voted early, at a polling site or by mail. That’s six times as many as had voted at that point in the 2016 election. The numbers show that people are eager to vote. They also show that people are concerned about voting in person. That’s because of the pandemic.
This data is from the United States Elections Project, which is run by Michael McDonald. He’s a professor at the University of Florida. “This will be a high-turnout election,” he says.
Some states begin counting early votes as they arrive. Others wait for Election Day. The public will not see results before then. There are lots of mail-in ballots to count. So we might not know the winner right away.
Eddie Perez is an election expert. “Many people are passionate about participating in this election,” he told National Public Radio on October 18.

A 14-year-old from Frisco, Texas, has won the 2020 3M Young Scientist Challenge. On October 14, Anika Chebrolu was announced as America’s Top Young Scientist. Her research could lead to a treatment for COVID-19.
Anika found a molecule that can attach to a protein on the new coronavirus. This could stop the virus from entering a cell. Her discovery could increase a drug’s effectiveness in fighting the disease.
Anika says her original idea for the project focused on the flu. But the coronavirus pandemic changed her plans. As winner of the competition, Anika received $25,000 and a trip. “It’s exciting,” she told her local CBS News station. “I’m still trying to process everything.”

396,396,This Week in TFK History: Climate Change,"{'World', 'History'}","
Time flies! The first issue of TIME for Kids was published in September 1995. That means TFK is turning 25. To honor our 25th anniversary, we’re pulling TFK stories from the archives and highlighting them in this space. Each archival issue relates to something in the news today. We hope these stories provide background for the things you’ll read about.

This week, we’re exploring how seaweed can combat climate change. TFK first wrote about the climate crisis in one of its earliest issues, dated September 29, 1995. Readers learned that the heat-trapping gases carbon dioxide and methane were causing the Earth to warm. They also learned about the harmful effects of climate change, such as rising sea levels and unpredictable weather.
Twenty-five years later, climate change is still in the headlines. As more people have become aware of the problem, they’ve spoken out about the urgent need for action. Activists have pressed leaders for climate-friendly policies. And young people around the world are taking charge in the fight to protect the planet.

Anti-racism protests spread across the country in 2020. These protests haven’t just happened in the streets. Calls for change have come from many industries, such as entertainment, technology, and professional sports.
Pro athletes have often spoken out against social injustice, even though it’s risky for them to do so. This year, more athletes have taken a stand. They are encouraging others to use their voices—and their votes. Fans see them as heroes. Teams count on them to bring in billions of dollars. So when athletes speak out, people listen. Here are three examples of how athletes are leading the way.
Getting Out the Vote 

Players from the Atlanta Falcons are urging people to vote in the 2020 election. The players say it’s crucial to elect leaders who care about social justice. Before a game last month, Julio Jones and his teammates wore shirts quoting the late congressman John Lewis. He was an advocate for voting rights. The National Football League (NFL) has taken note. In August, it launched its own voting-education initiative. Several NFL teams will use their stadiums as voting sites.
Choosing Activism 

On August 26, athletes from the NBA and WNBA staged a protest against racism by refusing to play. Natasha Cloud (left), of the Washington Mystics, wasn’t with her teammates. She had already opted out of the season to help social-justice causes. She and Bradley Beal (center), of the Washington Wizards, teamed up. They led a march on Juneteenth, a holiday that honors the end of slavery in the United States. Here, they speak before the event. Cloud and Beal are active on social media. Like the Falcons, they’re asking people to vote.
Raising Her Voice

On September 12, tennis player Naomi Osaka won her second U.S. Open title in three years. But it wasn’t just her superb playing that made news. Osaka wore seven masks, one for each round of the tournament. Each named a Black victim of violence and racial injustice. Later, a reporter asked Osaka what message she wanted to send. She said, “The point is to make people start talking.”

400,400,Spooky Stories,"{'Books', 'Time Off'}","
Halloween is the perfect time to curl up with a book that will make you glad you’re safe at home. Here are three new spine-tingling tales. 
A Game Gone Wrong
In Hide and Seeker, by Daka Hermon, Justin is confused by his friend Zee’s behavior. A year ago, Zee went missing. Now he’s back. And he’s talking about a being called the Seeker. At Zee’s welcome-home party, hide-and-seek turns scary when players disappear into the realm of Nowhere. There, they meet the Seeker. “I want readers to be entertained by this spooky story, but more important, to feel empowered to face any challenge that comes their way,” Hermon told TIME for Kids.
Odd Occurrences
What would you do if you found a dog with red eyes? That’s what Eleanor has to figure out in Thirteens. Two of her pals see the dog too. The good news? The three friends have a special book to help them solve mysteries. The bad news? The book tells them that every 13th Halloween, three 13-year-olds in their town go missing. Kate Alice Marshall is the author of Thirteens. She told TFK that she hopes readers experience “the satisfaction of figuring out a puzzle just in time.”
Hotel Haunting
Meet JJ Jacobson in Midnight at the Barclay Hotel, by Fleur Bradley. JJ enjoys ghost hunting. So when his mother is invited to a haunted hotel, he persuades her to take him along. Soon, he and other guests find themselves at the center of a mystery. It’s up to them to discover who killed the hotel’s owner, Mr. Barclay. 
Bradley told TFK the book was inspired by a historic hotel near her home, in Colorado. “I listened to the ghost stories of people who lived there,” she says.

401,401,Space Junk,"{'Science', 'Space'}","
There are nearly 2,800 working satellites in space. That’s according to the Union of Concerned Scientists. We depend on these devices for technology we use every day, such as video calls and weather tracking. Scientists use them to study the Earth and space.
But many other satellites in orbit are broken and still floating around up there. Some of these eventually fall back toward the Earth. They either land or burn up in the atmosphere. Space junk is a problem. Debris floating around the Earth puts technology and future space missions at risk. Experts are working on a solution.

Trash Trouble
Orbital debris is a type of space junk. It’s any human-made object that has stopped working but continues to float around the Earth. This includes abandoned satellites and pieces of spacecraft. “It’s a  problem,” Vitali Braun told TIME for Kids. He’s an engineer at the European Space Agency (ESA). “You have a satellite or rocket stages put into space in the 1960s, and they’re still there.”
Space junk can also include fragments of objects. These occur when satellites collide with things. Or they result from an object crashing into an old rocket stage that has fuel in it. This can cause an explosion.

Heather Cowardin works at NASA. She says the United States is tracking more than 23,000 pieces of space debris (see “Too Much Junk”). These tiny fragments damage working satellites. This can affect research in space.
Cosmic Cleanup

Companies are working to clean up the debris. Astroscale is one based in Japan. It plans to launch a mission called ELSA-d. The mission will try using magnets to collect space debris. The idea is to get companies to put magnetic plates on the satellites they launch. An Astroscale spacecraft could attach to the magnetic plate and remove the satellite when it failed.

Another mission is led by a Swiss company called ClearSpace. ClearSpace plans to launch a debris-removal spacecraft in 2025. The craft will grab a piece of an old rocket, slow it down, and eject it back to Earth.

Governments are trying to help too. Some are updating their space guidelines. This is to limit the amount of debris created. The  of space “is not a single-agency or a single-country problem that we can solve,” says Cowardin. “We have to work on this together.”
Too Much Junk
Thousands of marble-size fragments and millions the size of pencil lead are orbiting Earth. That’s according to NASA’s Heather Cowardin. Some result from satellites colliding with other objects. Cowardin says fragments can travel extremely fast. And they damage working satellites. This chart from ESA shows the increase in space debris over time.

402,402,Nobel Prize Win,"{'Community', 'World'}","
The 2020 Nobel Peace Prize was awarded on October 9. It went to the World Food Programme (WFP). WFP is a United Nations agency. It provides emergency help to people who don’t have access to food. Its efforts have come at a crucial time. In 2020, there has been a rise in the number of people facing starvation. That’s because of the coronavirus pandemic.
Berit Reiss-Andersen heads the Norwegian Nobel Committee. It’s based in Oslo, Norway. She says the committee wants to “turn the eyes of the world towards the millions of people who suffer from or face the threat of hunger.”
WFP works mainly in places affected by conflict. Last year, the group worked in 88 countries. It provided food to 97 million people.
David Beasley leads WFP. In a statement, he said there’s no hope for a peaceful planet if people are hungry. The Nobel award, he said, “is a reminder that food security, peace, and stability go together.”

Halloween is probably going to look different this year. That’s because of the coronavirus pandemic. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has safety tips for the holiday.
Traditional Halloween activities can put people at risk, according to the CDC. They can spread the virus. Safer options include a virtual costume contest. Indoor activities should only be done with members of your household. These might include a home scavenger hunt. For outdoor activities, like pumpkin picking, people should stay six feet apart.
The CDC says costume masks are not a substitute for regular face masks. If you wear only a costume mask, it should cover your mouth and nose. And it should be made of at least two layers of breathable cloth.

405,405,Life on Venus?,"{'Science', 'Space'}","
Are we alone in the universe? Scientists have spent years searching deep into space for signs of life beyond our planet. Now they’ve found what might be life right next door. 
On September 14, scientists reported a big discovery. A gas was found in the clouds of Venus. It’s called phosphine. On Earth, the gas is made by living things. It comes from places such as swamps and animals’ intestines.
Scientists can’t yet prove that life on Venus is what’s producing the phosphine. But they can’t explain the gas in any other way, either.
Sara Seager is a planetary scientist. She helped discover the phosphine on Venus. “It is a big deal,” she told TIME for Kids. “Phosphine is such a mysterious gas, and it shouldn’t be on Venus.” 
The Meaning of Life
Venus is the hottest planet in our solar system. It’s also one of the brightest objects in the night sky. The planet is surrounded by thick clouds. Until recently, no one thought there could be life on Venus. People thought the clouds were too  for a living thing to survive there. 
Clara Sousa-Silva is an astrochemist. She was also on the team that spotted phosphine in Venus’s clouds. She has spent her career looking for signs of life in space. “I hadn’t considered our solar system was a good place to look for life,” Sousa-Silva says. “And definitely not Venus because Venus is so awful.” 
Missions to Venus could find out more about the gas. If there’s life on the planet, scientists would expect it to be something like . 
Discovering life beyond Earth would teach us more about our place in the universe.

406,406,8 Questions for Daniel Holz,{'Space'},"
Daniel Holz is an astrophysicist at the University of Chicago, in Illinois. He’s also a member of LIGO. It’s an observatory that studies black holes. He spoke with TFK Kid Reporter Miguel Madero. 
1. What is a black hole?
A black hole is a region of space where  is so strong that nothing can escape it, not even light. 
2. Can you explain that?
Say you’re standing on the Earth. If you could make a super-high jump, you could get off the Earth and go into space, like a rocket. But near the surface of a black hole, the gravity is so strong that even if you went as fast as possible—at the speed of light—you wouldn’t be able to get away.
3. What happens if a planet or star is pulled into a black hole?
If any object falls in, it gets stretched out into individual . Even the atoms get ripped apart.
4. Are there any black holes close to Earth?
No. But we think there are lots of black holes in our Milky Way galaxy. The nearest are hundreds of light-years away. That’s far. One light-year is about 6 trillion miles. So at the speed of light, it would take hundreds of years to get to these black holes.

5. How do black holes form?
We think they are formed by the death of stars. Stars burn and glow. Eventually, they run out of fuel and collapse. When stars collapse, some form black holes. 
6. How does LIGO work? 
LIGO is the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory. It’s like a telescope. But instead of looking for light from distant stars and galaxies, it listens for gravitational waves caused by black holes. Now, these waves are not sound. They’re ripples in the fabric of the universe. LIGO uses powerful lasers and mirrors to detect these ripples. 
7. What has LIGO discovered?
LIGO has found black holes of all sizes. Recently, we found one that was 85 times the mass of the sun. That’s like taking 85 of our suns and crunching them down into one black hole. That’s big. There was another black hole spiraling into it. That one was 60 to 65 times the mass of the sun.
8. Why is this discovery important?
Black holes form when stars collapse. But we think that collapsing stars can’t make black holes that are 85 times the mass of the sun. They would blow up first. That means there must be some other way to make black holes that we don’t know about yet. That’s exciting, because now we have to figure out what’s going on.

Trump stood by his record. He thinks he’ll win. “I think we’re going to do well,” he said. “People are really happy with the job we’ve done.”
Biden said Americans want change. “Show up and vote,” he said. “You have it in your control to determine what this country is going to look like [for] the next four years.”

Days later, Trump made an announcement. He’d tested positive for COVID-19. The news caused concern among Americans. At press time, Trump was still undergoing treatment. Election Day is just weeks away. Early voting has already begun. This has been an election season like no other.
Meet the Candidates
The Constitution says a president can serve two four-year terms. Trump took office in 2017. His vice president is Mike Pence. They are Republicans.
If reelected, Trump has said he’ll rebuild the U.S. economy. It has suffered because of the pandemic. “We built the greatest economy in the history of the world. And we are doing it again,” he said. He was speaking at a rally. It was in Swanton, Ohio. That was on September 21. 

Before he became president, Trump had a career in business. He built hotels and apartments. And he hosted a TV show. Pence was the governor of Indiana. And he served in the U.S. House of Representatives. He did so for 12 years.
Biden is a Democrat. He was President Barack Obama’s vice president. That was from 2009 to 2017. Before that, Biden was a U.S. senator. He represented the state of Delaware. He served in the Senate for 36 years. 

Biden promised to get the pandemic under control. “You can’t fix the economy until you fix the COVID crisis,” he said. That was on at the debate on September 29.  
Kamala Harris is Biden’s running mate. She’s a U.S. senator from California. If elected, she’d be the country’s first female vice president. Harris is the first Black woman and the first person of Asian descent on a major party’s presidential . Her parents came to the U.S. from Jamaica and India.  

Other people are running for president too. None is expected to win a large share of the votes.
The Home Stretch
Usually, presidential candidates travel the country. They meet with voters. But this election is different. That’s because of the pandemic. Many campaign events have been held virtually. The candidates have made fewer in-person appearances.   
Trump’s illness has shaken up the election. But he and Biden continue to fight for votes. Americans await the results. The winning candidate is scheduled to be sworn in on  Day. It will be January 20, 2021.

410,410,Trump COVID Update,"{'United States', 'Government'}","
President Donald Trump was released from Walter Reed medical center, in Bethesda, Maryland, on October 5. He’d been admitted on October 2. That day, Trump announced that he’d tested positive for COVID-19. At press time, 14 people close to the president had also tested positive. 
Sean Conley is the president’s doctor. He said Trump would continue treatment at the White House. The president may not be “out of the woods yet,” Conley added. He said it could take about a week before Trump was fully out of danger. Experts say COVID-19 is unpredictable. But Trump has said he’s eager to get back to campaigning.
Recently, Trump has held rallies and other events. He has not enforced requirements for masks or social distancing. Experts say these steps are important. They prevent the virus’s spread. At press time, 43,000 new COVID-19 cases were being reported daily in the United States. About 7.5 million Americans have been infected.

411,411,The Vice-Presidential Debate,"{'Government', 'Election 2020'}","
The first and only vice-presidential debate of the 2020 election took place on October 7. Vice President Mike Pence and Senator Kamala Harris squared off in Salt Lake City, Utah. Susan Page of USA Today was the moderator. For 90 minutes, Pence and Harris debated issues important to American voters. 
Much of the debate focused on the issue that is first in the minds of many Americans: the coronavirus pandemic. The virus has killed more than 210,000 people in the United States. Last week, President Donald Trump announced that he’d tested positive for the virus. Pence has tested negative. As a safety measure, Pence and Harris were separated onstage by plexiglass barriers.
Other topics discussed were the economy, health care, climate change, and foreign policy. 
The last question of the night was about leadership. It was from Brecklin Brown, an eighth grader from Springville Junior High School, in Springville, Utah. Page read the question. “If our leaders can’t get along, how are the citizens supposed to get along?” Brecklin wrote. She added, “Your examples could make all the difference to bring us together.”
Pence responded first. “In America, we believe in a free and open exchange of debate,” he said. But even when they disagree, Americans come together, he said. “We always come together and are always there for one another in times of need.” 
Harris said Brecklin’s question gave her hope. “When I hear your words, Brecklin, I know our future is bright, because it is that perspective on who we are and who we should be that is a sign of leadership, and is something we should all aspire to.”
The next debate is scheduled to take place on October 15, between Trump and Joe Biden. Trump is the Republican nominee; Biden is the Democratic nominee. Today, the Commission on Presidential Debates announced that the event would take place virtually instead of in person. This is “in order to protect the health and safety of all involved.” Hours later, the president said he would not participate in a remote debate. The Biden campaign responded by saying the debate should be moved to a later date.

412,412,8 Questions for Molly Ball,"{'People', 'Election 2020'}","
Molly Ball is the national political correspondent at TIME, TFK’s parent publication. She’s covered many presidential elections. TFK’s Shay Maunz spoke with Ball about her job. 
How long have you been a journalist covering politics?
I started covering politics in 2006. Before that, I was a general-assignment news reporter. Technically, my journalism career goes back to the fifth grade, when I started my own newspaper in my neighborhood outside of Denver, Colorado. 
What do you like most about your job?
As a reporter, my goal is to tell interesting and important stories. And there are a lot of them in politics and government.
Why is it important to have journalists covering politics? 
In a democracy, it’s up to voters to decide who our nation’s leaders are. To do that, they need reliable information. They need true information that is coming from sources who don’t work for any of the politicians in question, and who aren’t trying to benefit one side or the other. Journalists are only interested in finding out the truth. 
What’s a typical day on the job like? 
Usually, in a presidential election year, I spend a lot of time traveling around the country, following the candidates. On the campaign trail, I talk to voters to see what they’re thinking. I also talk to experts, and to people who know the candidates and can help me understand them. I talk to as many people as possible to figure out what’s going on. 
What has this campaign season been like for you? 
To be honest, it’s no fun. I wish I could be out on the road. In a normal year, I would be on a plane every few days and talking to lots of people. It would be very exciting. Instead, I’ve mostly been sitting at home talking with my sources on the phone. Like everyone else, I’ve been communicating mostly through a screen. 
How do you decide what stories to write? 
I read a lot of news from different outlets, and I read polls. I talk to people inside the campaigns and listen to the candidates to see what issues they’re emphasizing, what message they’re trying to put out. Then I try to figure out, “Why are they doing that? Why do they think that’s an important thing to communicate to voters?” 
How do you stay fair?
The most important thing for a political reporter is for people to feel confident that you’re not rooting for one side or the other, and that you are presenting the truth. You have to prove your credibility by treating everybody fairly. As journalists, we’re tough on politicians because they have a lot of power, and we need to make sure we’re holding them accountable. But we have to be equally tough with everybody in order to be fair. 
Do you have advice for a kid who might want to become a journalist? 
Read everything you can get your hands on, not just the newspaper. Read fiction, poetry, and nonfiction, to see how language works and to learn more about what’s going on in the world. And write as often as you can.

413,413,TFK Explains: Voting in 2020,"{'Government', 'Election 2020'}","
When is Election Day?
According to United States law, Election Day is the Tuesday right after the first Monday in November, in even-numbered years. In 2020, Election Day is November 3. Americans will vote for a number of things. These include who should be president of the United States. 
What if someone can’t vote in person on Election Day?
Many states allow people to vote at a polling place before Election Day. This is called early voting. It can start as soon as 45 days before Election Day. Some people are unable to vote in person. So all 50 states and Washington, D.C., allow voting by mail.
Who can vote by mail? 
This year, most registered voters have the option to vote by mail. Because of the pandemic, many people are worried about voting at a crowded polling place. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has asked Americans to consider “voting alternatives.” One of these is mail-in voting. Election officials are making it easier for voters to submit mail-in ballots.

How does mail-in voting work? 
A voter is mailed a ballot. He or she fills it out and seals it inside two envelopes, with a signature. Then it’s mailed to the election office. In some locations, ballots can be placed in a secure drop box. This procedure varies. Elections are run by state and local governments. Each has its own system. 
How secure is voting by mail? 
Some people, including President Donald Trump, have expressed concern about the security of voting by mail. But experts say fraud is extremely rare. Officials are on the lookout for people who send in more than one ballot or who vote under someone else’s name.
When will we know who won the presidential election?
Usually, election results are unofficially announced on election night. But mail-in ballots take longer to count. And more people than usual are expected to vote by mail this year. It could be days or weeks before a winner is made official.

414,414,This Week in TFK History: Elections,"{'United States', 'History'}","
Time flies! The first issue of TIME for Kids was published in September 1995. That means TFK is turning 25. To honor our 25th anniversary, we’re pulling TFK stories from the archives and highlighting them in this space. Each archival issue relates to something in the news today. We hope these stories provide background for the things you’ll read about.

This week, we’re bringing you TIME for Kids’ Election 2020, which looks ahead to Election Day, November 3. Americans will cast their votes for the candidate they think should serve as president of the United States for the next four years. 
TFK has covered every presidential election since our founding, 25 years ago. That includes a historic one that took place on November 7, 2000. The two main candidates were Republican George W. Bush and Democrat Al Gore. But by the November 17, 2000, issue, pictured here, TFK was still unable to report on a clear winner. Election results were too close to call. Votes were recounted. Eventually, the U.S. Supreme Court weighed in, deciding the election in Bush’s favor. He went on to become the 43rd U.S. president. 


",g3456
415,415,By the Numbers,"{'Government', 'Election 2020'}","
In most United States elections, the candidate with the most votes wins. But when picking a president, things aren’t so simple. There’s a group of 538 people called the electoral college. Weeks after Election Day, ­they will elect the president.
Here’s how the electoral college works. A state gets an electoral vote for each of its two senators. This never changes. It also gets one vote for each of its members of the House of Representatives. That number is based the state’s population. Washington, D.C., gets electoral votes too. There are 538 electoral votes in all. A candidate needs at least 270 to become president. 
In 48 states (and D.C.), the winner of the popular vote gets all of that state’s electoral votes, even if he or she wins by a just a little. In Maine and Nebraska, the electoral votes can be split between the candidates.
A Long Tradition 
The Constitution established the electoral college. Some of the Founding Fathers wanted Congress to pick the president. Others wanted citizens to make the choice. The electoral college was a compromise. This way, candidates have to seek the votes of all Americans. Otherwise, they might just seek the vote of people living in large cities.
In 2000, George W. Bush won fewer popular votes than Al Gore. But he had more electoral votes. He went to the White House. In 2016, Donald Trump won fewer votes than Hillary Clinton. But he won the presidency. 
Many people think elections should be won by popular vote. They say that would be more fair. Others think the electoral college keeps states with large populations from having too much power. What do you think?

416,416,Let's Talk! With Kayla Miller,"{'Books', 'Time Off'}","
Author Kayla Miller talks with TFK Kid Reporter Jeremy Liew about voting, activism, and Miller’s graphic novel Act. 
1. Tell me about the book.
Act is a graphic novel about a sixth grader named Olive who finds out that one of her friends missed the class trip because of an unfair circumstance. Olive does her best to fix the situation for kids in the future. She learns about different ways she can take action to make a change at her school, such as protesting, fundraising, and running for student council. Act also touches on friendship issues, like handling disagreements and how relationships change over time. 
2. What’s your process for creating a graphic novel?
I write first. I usually start with an outline that goes over the basics of the story. Then I expand upon that and write a script like you would have for a movie or a play. Then I start doing the artwork. 
3. There’s voting in Act. What do you want readers to learn about voting?
Voting can help people participate, not only in government but also in a community. But voting is just one way to use your voice. There are other ways to make a change in your community.
4. How can a graphic novel help students understand activism? 
Like all books, graphic novels are a good way to relate to other people. But graphic novels, in particular, can appeal to people who might not be interested in reading nonfiction.
5. One of the characters in Act says, “If you see something unfair and think you can help, all that matters is that you act on it. That you do something.” How can kids muster the power to act?
It’s important to lean on the people around you and draw courage from the brave things you see them doing. If you feel you have the ability to be strong for someone else and be vocal for someone else, you should try to do that.

417,417,Trump’s COVID-19 Treatment Continues,"{'United States', 'Government'}","
President Donald Trump spent the weekend being treated for COVID-19 at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, in Bethesda, Maryland. He was admitted to the hospital on Friday. Earlier that day, he announced that he’d tested positive for the virus.
Sean Conley is the president’s doctor. He leads the team responsible for his care at Walter Reed. Conley told reporters on Sunday that Trump’s health “has continued to improve.” He added that the president could be released from the hospital as early as Monday. 
Conley says the president is being treated with a combination of drugs to fight the coronavirus infection and block the virus from making copies of itself. Another drug reduces inflammation, which can happen when the immune system fights an infection.
On Sunday evening, the president posted a one-minute video message on Twitter. “It’s been a very interesting journey,” he said from the hospital. “I learned a lot about COVID.” 
Also on Sunday, Trump left the hospital for a short time to drive past supporters who’d gathered outside. Wearing a mask, he waved from the backseat of a vehicle. Some medical experts questioned his decision to leave the hospital. They say it put the health and safety of the Secret Service agents who rode in the car with Trump at risk. COVID-19 is highly contagious. But a spokesperson for the president said the drive “was cleared by the medical team as safe to do.”

It’s unclear where Trump caught the virus. Many people are looking at an event at the White House on September 26. That was the day Trump introduced his new Supreme Court nominee, Amy Coney Barrett. About 150 people gathered in the Rose Garden, shaking hands and hugging. Most did not wear masks. Trump also traveled last week for campaign events.
So far, 11 people close to the president have announced that they’ve tested positive for COVID-19. They include First Lady Melania Trump; staff members Hope Hicks, Nicholas Luna, and Bill Stepien; White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany; the president’s former counselor Kellyanne Conway; United States senators Mike Lee, Thom Tillis, and Ron Johnson; Republican National Committee chairwoman Ronna McDaniel; and former New Jersey governor Chris Christie.
Every day, some 43,000 new COVID-19 cases are reported in the U.S. Infections in the U.S. now stand at nearly 7.5 million since the pandemic began.

418,418,President Trump Has COVID-19,"{'United States', 'Government'}","
President Donald Trump announced on Twitter early today that he and First Lady Melania Trump have tested positive for the novel coronavirus. 
On Friday, a White House official said the president was experiencing “mild symptoms.” The president and First Lady plan to quarantine inside the White House.
The two were tested for the virus after a White House aide, Hope Hicks, tested positive. Hicks traveled with the president earlier in the week.
“Rest assured, I expect the president to continue carrying out his duties without disruption while recovering,” Trump’s doctor wrote in a letter on October 1. Vice President Mike Pence will take on the duties of the president if Trump becomes too ill. Pence has so far tested negative for the virus.
An Unpredictable Illness
COVID-19 has infected more than 34 million people in the world, including 7 million in the United States. More than 200,000 Americans have died of the disease.
Since the coronavirus outbreak started, experts have learned more about the disease and how to treat it. But COVID-19 affects people differently. Older people are at higher risk of serious illness related to the disease. President Trump is 74 years old. 
Trump is not the first world leader to have contracted the disease. British prime minister Boris Johnson, 56, became sick with the virus in March. He spent a week in the hospital and eventually returned to work. Brazil’s president, Jair Bolsonaro, 65, tested positive for COVID-19 in July.

419,419,An Unruly Debate,"{'Government', 'Election 2020'}","
The first debate of the 2020 presidential election took place on September 29. President Donald Trump and former vice president Joe Biden, the Democratic nominee, faced off in Cleveland, Ohio. The debate was held at Case Western Reserve University and Cleveland Clinic’s Health Education Campus. Fox News anchor Chris Wallace was the moderator. 
The 90-minute debate was intended to cover six topics. Fifteen minutes were given to each of them. They included both candidates’ records, the Supreme Court, the coronavirus pandemic, the economy, the unrest taking place in several U.S. cities, and the integrity and fairness of the election. The rules stated that the moderator would introduce each topic with a question. Trump and Biden would each have two minutes to respond to it. Then the candidates would have a chance to respond to each other.
The debate quickly became unruly. The candidates repeatedly insulted each other. The president frequently interrupted Biden. Both men spoke over each other. This made it hard to understand what was being said. At one point, Wallace said to the president, “The country would be better served if we allowed both people to speak with fewer interruptions.” 
Biden said Americans want change, and that they can trust the electoral process. “Show up and vote,” he said. “You have it in your control to determine what this country is going to look like [for] the next four years.”
President Trump stood by his administration’s record. He predicted he would win the election. “I think we’re going to do well,” he said, “because people are really happy with the job we’ve done.” 
Biden and Trump are scheduled to debate twice more, on October 15 and October 22. The candidates for vice president will meet for their first and only debate on October 7. The vice-presidential candidates are Mike Pence, the current vice president, and Kamala Harris, a United States senator from California.

420,420,TFK Talks with Apple’s Tim Cook,"{'Business', 'People'}","
On September 15, Tech giant Apple announced its new products at a special event broadcast online. Usually, events like this are held live, in person, and are packed with reporters. But because of the coronavirus pandemic, the company did things differently this year. Apple CEO Tim Cook made his announcement in a prerecorded video message filmed at Apple headquarters, in Cupertino, California.  
TFK Kid Reporter Rory Hu lives in Cupertino. After the Apple event, she and Cook met remotely. They talked about how Apple—and the U.S.—has adapted to the pandemic, the company’s efforts to protect the environment for future generations, and the importance of staying curious. 
1. What do you think about the effect the pandemic has had on digital learning?
I think it’s reminded everyone out there how important the teacher is. I think it’s also reminded everyone how important technology is. And the intersection of the two. When you have a great teacher and great technology, learning can go extremely well. I know it’s been very different for kids like yourself with remote learning, but I think you’ll look back on this time and it will be a period of great learning.
2. What has Apple done to help kids continue to be creative during the pandemic?
We view creativity as a very important skill, and we think that everyone is born with creativity. So what we want to do is give tools to bring out that creativity. We have tools for moviemaking, and to allow people to create music, to take photos, to write a book or a novel.
3. Why is health such an important topic for Apple?
You know, it’s always been an important topic, but we began to learn more about it several years ago when we started working on the Apple Watch. Our big idea was to give people information for them to empower them to lead a better life, to lead a healthier life. That has never been more important than it is [now] because the world is so stressful.
4. What can you tell TIME for Kids readers about Apple’s commitment to protecting the environment for future generations?
We’re very committed to protecting the environment. We want to leave the world better than we found it. For the last couple of years, we’ve run Apple on 100% renewable energy. No dirty energy at all. Also, a lot of the products that we sell are made of recycled parts. Even the packaging is recycled.
5. How has Apple been affected by the pandemic?
Like you, we’ve been working remotely since March. We’ve had to learn how to do a lot of things virtually. It’s been building a new muscle for us. It’s something we didn’t know how to do before the pandemic. We had to learn very quickly. I’ve been incredibly impressed with the resiliency of our team. They’ve really rallied. We’re finding new ways to work.
We also asked ourselves how we could contribute. How could we help other people in this pandemic? We designed and donated [millions of] face shields. We also sourced and distributed face masks. We gave a lot of money to different groups that were helping families and people that had fallen ill with the virus. 
6. What advice would you give to kids who have trouble studying at home during this time?
I would tell them to take their time and learn something cool. Learn something that they can use for a lifetime. I would really suggest learning how to code, because coding is nothing more than another language. It gives people the ability to create something and follow their passion. 
I would recommend staying a kid. Always keep your curiosity, always keep your passion and your idealism. Never believe that things can’t get better. Everything can get better. I’m a big believer that each generation stands on the shoulders of the previous one and goes further and does more, so I’d love kids to think of it like that.
7. Thank you very much for your time, Mr. Cook. It was an honor to interview you. I hope that one day I can talk to you in person. 
I hope so too, as soon as the pandemic is over.

421,421,TFK Kid Reporters: Meet Victoria,"{'People', 'Community'}","
Meet Victoria Hanson, one of the 10 outstanding kids selected to be a TFK Kid Reporter this school year. Victoria is 10 years old and lives in Chadds Ford Township, Pennsylvania. Gymnastics is Victoria’s favorite activity—she says she couldn’t live without a trampoline.
Finalists in the TFK Kid Reporter contest were judged on a number of factors. One of their assignments was to write an article about a hometown hero. Victoria’s story is about athlete Mo’ne Davis. You can read it below.

Little League sensation Mo’ne Davis is a hometown hero in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Mo’ne broke barriers by becoming the first girl to pitch and play in a winning game in the Little League World Series. 
Mo’ne started playing baseball at age 7. She was known for making her teammates feel good and cheering them up when they were upset. According to her former coach Steve Bandura, “When Mo’ne was playing in the Little League World Series, she did not get nervous, which surprised many people watching and playing.” 
With a 70-mph fastball, Mo’ne managed to also be the first girl to pitch a shutout in a Little League World Series. When she was 13, her accomplishments on the baseball diamond put her in the national spotlight. Mo’ne even became the first young person to appear on the cover of Sports Illustrated. 
Mo’ne’s fame has brought her into contact with many famous people, including Kylie Jenner, whom she traveled to London to meet. But Mo’ne’s greatest memories are not about meeting famous people or winning games. “My favorite memory from the years with the Taney Dragons was the time spent on the civil rights tour down South,” Mo’ne says. “It empowered me when I learned about the many struggles that African Americans faced during the fight for equality.” After the tour in the South, Mo’ne began to focus on finding ways to uplift the people around her, similar to the way she lifted her teammates’ spirits on the baseball field.
In addition to being a trailblazer, Mo’ne gives back to her community by volunteering at programs to inspire girls. She pitches for the softball team at Hampton University, but she also makes time to attend youth leadership events, girls’ summits, and community programs. She also speaks to girls about staying focused on their goals.
Mo’ne is a hero because she chose to believe in herself, to ignore negativity, and to do something that had never been accomplished. She has demonstrated the importance of giving back to her community. She’s an inspiration to the girls in the Philadelphia area because she shows kids how to overcome one of the most significant obstacles in life: self-doubt. Mo’ne Davis is a remarkable athlete and an even more remarkable person. She is truly a greater-Philadelphia hometown hero.

Meet Jeremy Liew, one of the 10 outstanding kids selected to be a TFK Kid Reporter this school year. Jeremy is 12 years old and lives in Riverside, Connecticut. He enjoys making movies and performing magic tricks.
Finalists in the TFK Kid Reporter contest were judged on a number of factors. One of their assignments was to write an article about a hometown hero. Jeremy’s story is about a teacher and entrepreneur who helps his community. You can read it below.

Everyone knows Superman. But do you know educator and entrepreneur Travis Sluss? He teaches students how to code by day and makes personal protection equipment (PPE) by night.
Sluss is known as Superman around Westchester County, New York. In 2010, he created MacInspires, a STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Math) program. It offers kids hands-on technology learning. This year, Sluss donated MacInspires resources to make face shields and masks for hospitals. 
Sluss made MacInspires free when COVID-19 first hit his community. “These 3D printers . . . can be used to make face shields,” he says. “We also have sewing machines for cotton masks.” Travis reached out to his online network to request material donations. He donated the extra $2,250 to food banks. 
In addition to donating more than 416 shield frames, 981 shield fronts, 1,000 face masks, 174 ear guards, and 33 door hooks, Sluss 3D printed a newly invented aerosol box. He explains the aerosol box is “a plexiglass box [for the infected] patient’s head while they are laying down in the hospital.” 
According to the U.S. Department of Education, 16% of high school seniors are interested in STEAM. Travis makes subjects such as robotics, SpaceX, and woodshop available to everyone.  “As a youth, it was a struggle to find places and opportunities to further these passions and that was a major motivating factor in driving me to open and create MacInspires,” says Sluss. He uses technology to mentor lifelong learners in his community and teaches more than 400 students and teachers at schools and libraries. “What’s neat is you see them mature over the course of time they’re here,” says Sluss. 
Sluss used COVID-19 as a teaching moment for his students. One of his students, seventh grader Michael Joseph, said learning 3D printing taught him “how to make things to help others.” 
MacInspires director of Operations Margaret Mullen says, “Travis is a hero because he works with students to enhance their innate intellectual abilities which often aids them in choosing futures in computer science, engineering, and beyond.”
In the time of COVID-19, it’s technological innovators and community leaders like Travis Sluss who are the 21st-century local heroes. It’s a bird, it’s a plane, it’s SuperTravis!

423,423,Honoring Ruth,"{'United States', 'People'}","
Ruth Bader Ginsburg died on September 18, in Washington, D.C. She was 87. She had served as a United States Supreme Court justice since 1993. Ginsburg was the second woman to sit on the nation’s top court. She fought fiercely for women’s rights.
At memorials around the country, people lit candles. “Women belong in all places where decisions are being made,” read some.

After two days at the Supreme Court Building, Ginsburg was to lie in  at the U.S. Capitol on September 25. She is the first woman in U.S. history to have been given this honor.
Ginsburg faced discrimination because of her gender. This led her to support equal pay and opportunities for women. She became a role model and icon.

Journey to the Court
Joan Ruth Bader was born in 1933 in Brooklyn, New York. As a young girl, she loved books. One day, reading while walking, she fell and broke her nose.
Ruth graduated from high school and went to Cornell University. There, she met Martin Ginsburg. They married in 1954.
Ruth and Marty were accepted to Harvard Law School. But he was called for military duty. Ruth paused her studies. She took a job at the U.S. Social Security Administration. When her employer found out she was pregnant, Ruth was given a lesser role at lower pay.
In 1956, Marty and Ruth were at Harvard. She was one of nine women in a class of more than 500. After Marty learned he had cancer, Ruth went to class for him. She typed up his papers. When Marty got a job in New York, Ruth went with him. She finished her studies at Columbia Law School.
Ruth graduated from Columbia in 1959. She tied for first in her class. But she was unable to get a job at a big law firm. And Supreme Court  went to men.

Ruth didn’t get angry. She got even. She taught at Rutgers Law School from 1963 to 1972. She pushed for equal pay for women there. She began teaching at Columbia in 1972. She helped start the Women’s Rights Project at the American Civil Liberties Union. And in 1980, she joined the U.S. Court of Appeals.
“I Dissent”
President Bill Clinton appointed Ginsburg to the Supreme Court in 1993. She was sworn in on August 10. She had become a voice for gender equality. Ginsburg ruled on a number of  cases in her career.

A Supreme Court justice can write a dissenting opinion when he or she disagrees with the majority. Ginsburg did this often. In 2014, she explained why. “I am ever hopeful that if the court has a blind spot today, its eyes will be open tomorrow,” she said.
In Memory
On September 19, the Supreme Court released statements from the eight current justices. They wrote about Ginsburg. Here are some of their words.
“Today we mourn, but with confidence that future generations will remember Ruth Bader Ginsburg as we knew her—a tireless and resolute champion of justice.” —Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr.
“She was a superb judge who gave her best and exacted the best from each of us, whether in agreement or disagreement.” —Justice Clarence Thomas
“My dear friend and colleague Ruth Bader Ginsburg was an American hero. She spent her life fighting for the equality of all people, and she was a pathbreaking champion of women’s rights.” —Justice Sonia Sotomayor
“Justice Ginsburg will go down as a leading figure in the history of the court. She will be remembered for her intelligence, learning, and remarkable fortitude. She has been and will continue to be an inspiration for many.” —Justice Samuel A. Alito

424,424,TFK Explains: The Supreme Court,"{'United States', 'Government'}","
Supreme Court justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died on September 18. TFK explains the importance of the court and looks at how the next justice will be chosen. 
What is the Supreme Court? 
The Supreme Court is the nation’s top court. It decides whether laws follow the United States Constitution. It also explains how laws should be applied. Its decisions become the law of the land.
The court is made up of eight associate justices and one chief justice. The chief justice heads the U.S. government’s judicial branch. The court acts as a check on the powers of Congress (the legislative branch) and the president (the executive branch). 
The Supreme Court mostly rules on cases that were already heard in lower courts around the country. It has the power to undo the decisions of those courts. Its rulings are usually final. 
Who picks the justices for the Supreme Court? 
Justices are chosen by the president. But they must be confirmed, or approved, by the Senate. A majority of the Senate’s 100 members must agree to confirm a nominee. 
For how long do Supreme Court justices serve?
A justice may serve for life. That means whoever is picked next could be involved in decisions for decades to come.
How do Supreme Court justices make decisions?
Justices are expected to judge cases based only on the Constitution. But their personal values and beliefs can influence how they interpret it. 
Who will replace Justice Ginsburg? 
At press time, President Donald Trump had not yet nominated a replacement. He has said he will probably nominate a woman. 
When will the Senate vote to confirm a nominee? 
Most Republican senators want to vote on a nominee before the November 3 presidential election. Other senators disagree. They say the nomination should be delayed. They think the person who wins the election should nominate the next justice. 
That’s what happened in 2016. That year, a seat opened up on the court. The Senate would not vote on a nominee. It said it would wait until after the election. Trump won. He nominated the next justice soon after taking office.

426,426,Handwashing Helper,"{'World', 'Health'}","
Handwashing is an easy way to protect against disease, including COVID-19. But how do you wash your hands if you don’t have running water?
Lack of running water and soap is a problem for 3 billion people in the world. That’s according to the World Health Organization and UNICEF, the United Nations Children’s Fund. Tippy taps are one solution. They’re helping people stay healthy. 
Clean Hands Around the World
Faridah Luanda lives in a  settlement. It’s in Uganda. She has been teaching her neighbors how to make tippy taps. “Washing hands is very difficult in our community,” Luanda told TIME for Kids. “We needed to be creative.” 
There are different ways to build and use tippy taps. The basic tools include a plastic water bottle, soap, and rope. Hang the bottle from a branch or pole. Press a foot pedal to tip the bottle and release water. Wet your hands. Then scrub with soap for at least 20 seconds. Done!
In Guatemala, a group called Buenos Vecinos (“good neighbors”) has built tippy taps. They teamed up with the Rotary Club of Columbia Falls, Montana. “Sometimes, the little things make such a big difference,” says Dave Renfrow. He’s a Rotary Club member and project leader. 
Kids from the Lake & Park School, in Seattle, Washington, heard about the project. They raised $4,000 to support it. 
Tippy taps are also being used in Tucson, Arizona. They’re helping the homeless. Two taps were set up at a shelter. The pandemic forced it to close . But workers were still passing out food. “We needed a way to let people wash their hands” before eating, Jean Fedigan says. She runs the shelter. “The tippy tap is such a simple solution.”  
Luanda agrees. When TFK spoke to her, she and her neighbors had set up 800 tippy taps. “We are helping ourselves,” Luanda says. “Children, people with disabilities, other vulnerable people—they cannot be left behind.”

427,427,Can't Stop the Sponge,"{'Technology', 'Arts'}","
The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run moved Mireille Soria to tears. “It was so beautiful,” she told TIME, describing what it was like to see the finished film for the first time.
You might not normally expect SpongeBob to make a grown-up cry. But Soria is the president of Paramount Animation. That’s the company that produced the film. Nothing in recent months has been even close to normal there. 
Like people at many companies, Paramount Animation’s employees have been working from home since mid-March. They made Sponge on the Run as the coronavirus pandemic tore through the country. For these producers, animators, and editors, seeing the completed film might certainly have moistened some eyeballs. “I’m so proud of that movie,” Soria says. “[It] has so much heart.”
New Way to Work
Paramount Animation’s staff was fortunate to be able to work remotely. But the process wasn’t all smooth sailing.
One problem was recording the music for Sponge on the Run. Putting performers together was too risky. Instead, musicians recorded their parts in local studios. Then sound engineers put the parts together. It’s a “really beautiful, rich score,” Soria says. “I don’t think you can tell the difference, from how it was done.”
For Soria, the challenges of the past few months have created unexpected opportunities. “Even though this is a terrible time in the world right now, there are things that we’re learning that we can take forward and find a new way or a better way to do,” she says.
In the world of animation, that means rethinking how movies get made. For example, do people really need to be together in the same location to make a great movie? “There’s [that] perception, because it’s the way it’s been done,” Soria says. “I don’t believe that is the only way to do it. And I don’t know that that is the right way to do it.”
“The rule is: There are no rules,” she adds. “If there is an artist who lives in New Zealand or in London or in Iowa . . . and [he or she] can contribute to it—that, to me, is unbelievably valuable.”

A magical quest, middle school drama, and a feathered serpent fill the pages of three new graphic novels. Find out more about these illustrated stories.
Travel Partners
Set off on a quest in the new graphic novel Lightfall: The Girl & the Galdurian, by Tim Probert. Bea lives with her adoptive grandfather, the Pig Wizard. Together, they make potions and tonics for the people of their planet, Irpa. Then Bea meets Cad. He’s a Galdurian, a race of creatures thought to be extinct. When Bea’s grandfather goes missing, the two go in search of him and Cad’s lost people.
Probert told TIME for Kids that Bea and Cad are different, but “together, they make a surprisingly good team.”
Twin Trouble
In Twins, Maureen and Francine are twins. Maureen thinks they’re also best friends. But as the sisters enter sixth grade, Francine changes.
Varian Johnson is the book’s author. Illustrations are by Shannon Wright. “My oldest daughter loves graphic novels,” Johnson told TFK. “We struggled to find graphic novels where Black girls were the main characters.” He adds, “Shannon was able to breathe life into each and every character. In many ways, Twins is a love letter to Black girls.”
Snake Fighter
In Tales of the Feathered Serpent: Rise of the Halfling King, a boy named Sayam—half elf, half human—steps up to save a city from a giant feathered serpent. The serpent is a prominent creature in the religion of the ancient Maya, a culture native to Mexico and Central America.
“The ancient Maya blended words and art in the books they created,” says David Bowles, the author. “I figured a graphic novel would respect the way people in Mexico have always shared their stories.” Charlene Bowles did the illustrations. “It has a great mix of action, tension, and humor,” she says. “The legend of the halfling king is fascinating.”

429,429,TFK Kid Reporters: Meet Donnell,"{'People', 'Community'}","
Meet Donnell Meekins, one of the 10 outstanding kids selected to be a TFK Kid Reporter this school year. Donnell is 10 years old and lives in Carson, California. Donnell likes board games and playing the drums. As a TFK Kid Reporter, he hopes to interview Beyoncé.
Finalists in the TFK Kid Reporter contest were judged on a number of factors. One of their assignments was to write an article about a hometown hero. Donnell’s story is about a social-justice champion in his community. You can read it below. We’ll be introducing the rest of the TFK Kid Reporter squad throughout September. 

A hometown hero gives back. He or she stands up for justice and raises awareness to better the community. Olatunde Kosoko, also known as Tunde, is a hometown hero.
Humble and funny, when asked for an interview, Kosoko said, “I’m a hometown hero? Seriously? Me? I’m honored!”
According to the National Education Association, social justice means “providing society-wide equity for all people rather than only a few.” Kosoko has a history of social-justice work in the community. He has volunteered for Trajectory of Hope. That’s a nonprofit group focused on young Black boys’ emotional health. Kosoko’s work with the Children’s Defense Fund Freedom School has helped children who experience poverty.
Kosoko has worked to further the mission of the Community Coalition. The Community Coalition helps provide opportunity and justice in South Los Angeles by organizing young people to learn about and change laws. Kosoko helped inner-city children through storytelling, by using fictional characters with similar backgrounds.
“The most frustrating part of my work is pushing students to finish work when they do not want to complete it,” Kosoko says. His favorite part of the work is pushing those same students to graduate.
Kosoko’s work at Social Justice Learning Institute (SJLI), in Inglewood, California, empowers communities to educate themselves and take action for positive change. He provides tutoring and other support for students in ninth grade to college and teaches social-justice classes. Some days, Kosoko helps with college applications. On others, he plans social-justice community gatherings.
Amarion is one of Tunde's former students. They met at a pizza party. “I came for pizza and left a part of SJLI,” Amarion says. “Tunde has encouraged me to be more responsible.”
Kevin is a 21-year-old musician. He met Kosoko on an SJLI college tour. “Tunde made SJLI a comfortable and productive place to be,” Kevin says. He has followed in Kosoko’s footsteps, working with the Community Coalition. 
Now, Kosoko is creating a support group at SJLI where young men can share feelings about protests, racism, and police brutality. He’s a social justice-champion who deserves the title of hometown hero.

Meet Sophia Hou, one of the 10 outstanding kids selected to be a TFK Kid Reporter this school year. Sophia is 11 years old and lives in Short Hills, New Jersey. She likes to grow vegetables in her garden, and she hopes to one day interview Jane Goodall.
Finalists in the TFK Kid Reporter contest were judged on a number of factors. One of their assignments was to write an article about a hometown hero. Sophia’s story is about Samantha Friedman, the founder of the Kitten Nursery in Ledgewood, New Jersey. You can read it below. We’ll be introducing the rest of the TFK Kid Reporter squad throughout September. 

Samantha Friedman saves lives in the Kitten Nursery at St. Hubert’s Animal Welfare Center, in Ledgewood, New Jersey. This neonatal intensive care unit provides a haven for newborn kittens, mother cats, and older or feral cats who need special treatment to rest and heal. 
As of July 16, Friedman and her team have saved more than 630 lives. That’s since the Kitten Nursery started, in April 2019. 
Friedman has worked as a veterinarian technician for almost 20 years. The idea for the Kitten Nursery sparked four years ago when she was moving kittens that needed 24-hour care back and forth from St. Hubert’s to her home in Pequannock, New Jersey. 
Friedman started the Kitten Nursery with 11 cages and three incubators in a small room at St. Hubert’s. Sometimes taking care of more than 40 kittens at a time, she often slept there overnight. 
In the Kitten Nursery, Friedman uses equipment such as nebulizers, microwaveable heating disks, and stuffed animals with a simulated heartbeat to soothe the kittens. “We make sure every kitten, no matter what the ailment is, gets one-on-one attention, and is closely monitored,” says Friedman. One kitten, named Cocoa, had severe pneumonia and struggled to breathe. After receiving supportive care and breathing treatments, Cocoa made a full recovery and was adopted. 
Lori Nichols, who adopted two kittens from the nursery, says that Friedman “does anything and everything possible to save kittens, and when most people would have given up, she continues to work hard to help even the sickest of them get better.”
Brian Brooks is a volunteer at St. Hubert’s. “This would not be possible without her commitment and will to help those that cannot help themselves,” he says.
New Jersey shelters euthanized, or put to sleep, 7,418 cats in 2019. That’s according to the New Jersey Department of Health. Friedman is helping to lower that number. Jenna DeVito, another volunteer at St. Hubert’s, says, “Most of the kittens we get are from overcrowded shelters where they would either be euthanized or not receive the care they need.”
When COVID-19 struck and the shelter was forced to close, Friedman moved most of the kittens to her home, caring for them day and night. “There’s no division between my personal life and my career,” she says. “It’s a life’s mission, not just a job.” Friedman took in more than 60 kittens during the shelter’s closure.
Friedman remains steadfast in her dedication to saving lives and hopes she can save even more. “It's not a good time for anyone in animal rescue right now, but we won't give up,” she says. “We’ll keep fighting for the little guys.”

432,432,Race to a Vaccine,"{'World', 'Health'}","
A volunteer is sitting in an office in Binghamton, New York. She’s wearing a sundress. So there’s no need to roll up a sleeve. A researcher walks in and gives her a shot. “Well, that was painless,” the volunteer says, cheerfully.
That was July 27, the day the first potential coronavirus vaccine reached late-stage testing in the United States. It was made by Moderna and the National Institutes of Health. Human  began in March. Tens of thousands of volunteers would sign up. Now, two more companies have reached late-stage vaccine testing in the U.S.

A vaccine would protect people from COVID-19. With enough people , it would save lives. It would help end the pandemic. That’s why there’s a rush to develop it.
Need for Speed
A vaccine builds our  to a virus. “It teaches the body to recognize the virus,” Dr. Rick Malley told TIME for Kids. Malley works at Boston Children’s Hospital. That’s in Massachusetts. “The next time the body sees the bug,” he says, “it fights it off without ever getting sick.”
It can take 10 years to develop a vaccine (see “Road to Success”). Scientists have to do research. They have to produce a vaccine they can test. It must pass three phases of human trials. Then it can be approved, manufactured, and distributed.

Operation Warp Speed has made this process faster. The U.S. government launched the program in May. It gives billions of dollars to companies so they can quickly make coronavirus vaccines.
Some companies have used money from Operation Warp Speed to manufacture doses of a vaccine before the final phase of testing is complete. If it’s safe and effective, the vaccine can then be distributed right away.
Down the Line
It’s uncertain when a vaccine will be ready in the U.S. Robert Redfield is director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. On September 2, he spoke to Yahoo Finance. Redfield said “one or more vaccines” could be ready by the end of the year.
Moncef Slaoui is a scientist. He’s one of the leaders of Operation Warp Speed. On August 31, he spoke to National Public Radio. Slaoui said that “we may have enough vaccine by the end of the year [for] between 20 [million] and 25 million people.”
That means many people will have to wait. The first doses will likely go to health-care workers and elderly people. “We have to figure out how to make sure they’re distributed in a fair and  way,” Redfield says.

Other countries are working on vaccines too. Australia, China, India, Italy, Japan, Russia, Singapore, and South Korea are in the human-trials stages.
As the U.S. races toward a vaccine, safety is a top concern. On September 8, the leaders of nine companies working on vaccines in the U.S. issued a statement: They won’t release a vaccine before they’re sure it’s safe. They promise to make “the safety and well-being of vaccinated individuals our top priority.”
Road to Success
Making a new vaccine takes a lot of work. Here are the five steps.
Before trials: Scientists conduct research. They run early tests on cells and animals.
Phase 1: The vaccine is tested on a small group of human volunteers to make sure it’s safe.
Phase 2: The vaccine is tested on a slightly larger group of volunteers. This is to check for safety again.
Phase 3: The vaccine is tested on thousands of volunteers. Researchers find out if the vaccine is effective.
After trials: A vaccine may now be approved by the government. It can then be manufactured and distributed to the public.

Hurricane Sally made landfall near Pensacola, Florida, on September 16. It brought heavy rain. Winds reached 100 miles per hour. At press time, Sally was expected to move across Alabama and into Georgia.
The storm moved slowly. It crawled at about 2 mph. This caused severe flooding in Alabama and Florida. As much as 30 inches of rain was predicted in some areas before Sally moved on.
Flooding was made worse by a storm surge. This is a rise of seawater. Some places along the coast were braced for seawater between six and nine feet high.
Officials ordered residents in coastal cities to evacuate. Shelters were set up for people who left their homes. In Florida, the National Guard prepared for search-and-rescue operations.
Forecasters compared Sally to Hurricane Harvey. That storm was in 2017. It swamped Houston, Texas.

When we want to see art, where do we go? The pandemic has made it hard to visit museums and galleries. But sometimes, we can find art outside in the neighborhood.
Murals are large artworks. They are painted on walls. Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, is known for its murals. Mural Arts Philadelphia has helped create nearly 4,000 of them. Often, these works represent the neighborhood in which they appear.
Lisa Murch is the director of art education at Mural Arts Philadelphia. “Art really belongs to everybody and should be everywhere,” she told TIME for Kids.
Mural Arts runs a youth program. The group teaches kids how to make murals. Students get a chance to work with professional artists.
Alaina Ewins joined Mural Arts when she was 13. She’s now a teaching artist for the program. Ewins’s first big project was a mural inside her local youth center. “We got to design the mural and paint it, which was awesome,” she says.
Ewins likes to see how making murals affects a neighborhood.  with people in the community is important, she feels. Artists work with people in the neighborhood to design murals.
Art During Hard Times
COVID-19 has temporarily changed mural making. Artists have to practice social distancing. They are unable to work on the murals together in person. Murch says some artists are painting pieces of murals at home. The pieces will later be put on a wall. They’ll fit together like a giant puzzle.
Murch feels the youth program is  during the pandemic. “Art is a really freeing way of expressing a lot of things,” she says. “During this time of stress and anxiety . . . I think that’s a wonderful thing for kids to access.”

437,437,8 Questions for Jennifer Eberhardt,"{'Community', 'History'}","
People are sometimes treated unfairly because of unconscious bias. TFK’s Brian S. McGrath spoke with social psychologist Jennifer Eberhardt about how to recognize bias, and how we might stop it.
1. What is unconscious bias?
Bias can be defined as the beliefs and feelings we have about people, based on their race, gender, age, or how much money their family has. When bias is unconscious, that means you have beliefs about people without knowing why you have them and how they affect the choices you make.
2. Can you give an example?
Let’s say you believe that girls are not good at math. You might not ask a girl for help with a math problem. Without thinking, you assume she can’t help you. That’s an example of gender bias.
3. Where does bias come from?
We learn it by watching how people around us react to others. When my son was in first grade, he asked me, “Do you think people feel a different way about Black people?” He remembered when we were in a grocery store and a Black man entered. White people stayed away from him. “It was like he had a force field around him,” my son said. He was already learning that some people are treated differently.
4. Is bias everywhere in our society?
We are all  to bias. We can learn it from movies, television, or books. Companies, or organizations like the police, might have policies that  race or gender bias.
5. How can we change this unfair behavior?
We can try to understand what is producing bias, then try to reduce it, in ourselves and in society.
6. What can kids do?
Kids have powers to fight bias that most adults don’t have. They’re not afraid of asking, “Why?” That’s how you learn how bias works. Kids are also able to develop close friendships with others of different races. They can learn to value difference.
7. How about talking with parents and teachers?
Yes! It’s important to talk about bias. If we don’t, it’s hard to understand what’s happening around us and see the damage it may be doing.
8. What if it makes adults uncomfortable?
It’s a learning opportunity for adults, too. If you don’t ask why leaders of companies tend to be white men, or why all of our presidents have been men, or why Black people don’t have all of the same opportunities—if we don’t talk about these things, bias will continue. Inequality will continue.

Meet Abby Rogers, one of the 10 outstanding kids selected to be a TFK Kid Reporter this school year. Abby is 10 years old and lives in Lahaina, Hawaii. She likes to free-dive in the ocean, and her biggest pet peeve is single-use plastic.
Finalists in the TFK Kid Reporter contest were judged on a number of factors. One of their assignments was to write an article about a hometown hero. Abby’s story is about Aunty Kathy, who teaches Hawaiian culture to locals and visitors. You can read it below. We’ll be introducing the rest of the TFK Kid Reporter squad throughout September.

When you picture Hawaii, you might think of palm trees swaying from side to side, a bright-blue ocean, a white-sand beach, and a little umbrella in a coconut-shell drink. But if you look a little closer, there’s a beautiful culture. One of the most knowledgeable people you can learn Hawaiiana from is Kathryn Holoaumoka Ralar, but the keiki (children) just call her Kumu Kathy, or Aunty Kathy. 
Aunty Kathy was born on April 25, 1960. She attended the Kamehameha Schools, on Maui, until she graduated, in 1978. She says she was raised in a “family full of dancers and musicians.” Aunty Kathy received her teaching certificate for hula in 1979 from well-respected hula teacher Aunty Emma Sharpe. 
Aunty Kathy has devoted herself to sharing Hawaiian culture with both locals and visitors. She has done some of her most meaningful work through the Napili Kai Foundation. According to its website, the foundation’s mission is “to perpetuate the cultural legacy of Hawaii through the children of Maui.”
Gregg Nelson is general manager of the Napili Kai Beach Resort. Speaking of the resort’s hula show, he says, “Because of [Aunty Kathy’s] commitment, this show is the longest-running children’s hula show in the entire state.” The audience enjoys traditional dances, colorful costumes, and live music. Aunty Kathy says the visitors also gain “the Aloha Spirit, and share something with people they don’t know about.”
For more than 40 years, children at the Napili Kai Foundation have been fortunate to have Aunty Kathy as their teacher. She teaches more than singing and dancing. She teaches important life skills, such as discipline, responsibility, and organization. And, of course, she teaches them about Hawaii’s history and culture. The program is free but requires a commitment in return. The foundation provides opportunities such as performing on the mainland and college scholarships. 
Namahina Kawabata, 16, has been studying hula for 11 years. She says the most important thing Aunty Kathy has shared with her is “her . . . love and knowledge of our culture.” 
“She’s brought it to life for me,” Namahina adds. “I have learned to share it with other people and how to continue to grow up and share the Aloha Spirit.”

Finalists in the TFK Kid Reporter contest were judged on a number of factors. One of their assignments was to write an article about a hometown hero. Miguel’s story is about Donna Inscore, a teacher in his town. You can read it below. We’ll be introducing the rest of the TFK Kid Reporter squad throughout September. 

A hero is someone whose actions change people’s lives. Donna Inscore, a teacher who stood up in front of first graders for almost 50 years and changed more than 1,000 kids’ lives, is a hero. After 45 years of teaching at Saint Mary’s Hall, in San Antonio, Texas, she has decided to retire this year.
Inscore’s parents were teachers, so thanks to that, she knew exactly what she wanted to do. Right after college, she was hired by Kate Schenck Elementary School, in San Antonio, Texas. She was 22 years old. The classrooms did not even have air conditioning. All they had was a fan in the corner of the room! Her first year of teaching was “very difficult,” Inscore says, though the kids were “very sweet.” 
After four years of teaching at Kate Schenck, Inscore transferred to Saint Mary’s Hall in 1972. “I had a very good feeling about her,” says Nur Mangalji, assistant head of Saint Mary’s Lower School. “She overall had a very good sense of humor.” 
Inscore says that kids and adults have written letters about what a good teacher she was. Her advice to young teachers is: “Get to know your kids. Every kid is different and has different needs.”

Jeremi Swietochowski is in fourth grade. He was playing with Legos when a bird hit his window. Jeremi went to check on the bird. “Just when I was about to open the door, it flew away,” he told TIME for Kids. 
Not all birds are so lucky. Between 365 million and a billion birds are killed each year in the United States by flying into glass. That’s according to a 2014 study. Bird  increase during the fall migration. 
“Birds take what they see literally,” Christine Sheppard says. She is director of the glass-collisions program at the American Bird Conservancy (ABC). “When they see a reflection of habitat—to them, that’s just more habitat that they can fly into.” Sheppard and others want to make buildings bird-friendly. 

By Design
There are three main ways to make a building bird-friendly. One is to use less glass. Another is to wrap a glass building with some kind of screen. The Orange Cube, in France, is a good example of this technique. 

A third strategy is to use special glass. This was done on the Javits Center. It’s a huge glass building in New York City. 
In 2009, the city decided to replace some of the glass. Metal panels were used. So was  and patterned glass.  
Daniel Piselli is an architect. He worked on the project. He says that with glass, “the main thing is to put something on it that birds can see, so they’re not fooled by reflections and . The trick is to do that in such a way that people can still enjoy the views and daylight through the glass.” 
Work on the Javits Center was completed in 2014. Bird collisions went down by 90%. 

Protecting Birds
Bird-friendly building design is required in only a few places in the U.S. These include San Francisco, California, and the state of Minnesota. A new building law will go into effect in New York City in December. 
Mike Quigley is a U.S. congressman. He’s trying to pass a national law for government buildings. “Eventually, I’d like to think that no one would build a building anywhere without doing this,” Quigley says. 

Connie Sanchez, of the National Audubon Society, agrees. “Talk to your lawmakers about this issue,” she says. “Get them to understand how important it is.” 
After the bird hit his window, Jeremi wanted to make sure it never happened again (see “Take Action”). He got permission to draw a grid on the glass. It’s “visible for birds,” his mom says, “but hardly noticeable for people.” 
Take Action

You can make your home safer for birds. “There’s a whole range of solutions that can be applied on the outside of windows,” Audubon’s Connie Sanchez says. Here are a few.
Screens They reduce reflection. 
Masking tape Strips should be spaced two to four inches apart.  
Artwork Use tempera paint. Most brands are easy to wash off later.
Inspired? “This is one of the few conservation issues where you can learn about it and do something about it the same day,” ABC’s Christine Sheppard says.

Dozens of wildfires are tearing through California. Two of them are among the three largest in the state’s history. Those fires are burning not far from San Francisco.
“The wildfire situation throughout California is dangerous and must be taken seriously,” Randy Moore told the AP. Moore is with the U.S. Forest Service.
In an average California fire season, about 300,000 acres burn. This year, wildfires have already destroyed more than 2 million acres.
Hundreds of people have been rescued by helicopter. At press time, fires had killed at least seven people. More than 3,300 structures were damaged.
More fires are likely. Peak wildfire season is just getting started in California. By now, summer heat has dried out plant life. High winds are common.
Parts of the Pacific Northwest are also burning. Thousands have lost power in Oregon. And in Washington, most of the small town of Malden was destroyed by flames.

Maggie Weymouth, 8, says her friends used to love playing with her chickens. She lives on a farm in Clarence, New York. But Maggie’s friends haven’t been able to come around lately. She misses spending time with kids her own age. 
Maggie has been home since March. That’s when the coronavirus pandemic forced her school to close. She hasn’t seen her friends in all that time. “I miss playing with them in the backyard,” Maggie told TIME for Kids.
Regine Galanti is a psychologist. She helps kids with  and other mental-health issues. She says many kids feel like Maggie does. Galanti and other experts say kids need to socialize. That means to spend time with your peers. 
“Socialization is one of the key factors in development,” she says. “It’s one of the most important things that we think about for kids in elementary school.”
New Ways to Connect 
Socializing has been put on pause for many kids. That’s because of the pandemic. So how can they keep building necessary social skills? 
One way is to keep in touch digitally. Genesis Gooden is 11. She lives in Virginia Beach, Virginia. “I keep wondering when this coronavirus is going to be over,” she says. For now, Genesis and her friends connect a few times a month over video chat. 
Galanti says one of the best ways to manage digital socialization is to make a schedule. Plan when you’re going to call each of your friends. For example, decide with one friend to chat on Zoom on Mondays. Plan an online gaming session with other friends on Wednesdays. “Build it into the schedule,” Galanti says.
Returning to in-person friendships might feel scary for some kids. But keeping in touch digitally will help. If you’re worried, Galanti has some advice: “Talk it through with an adult you trust.”

445,445,Should the Voting Age Be Lowered?,"{'Debate', 'Opinion'}","
To vote for president of the United States, a person must be 18 years old. In the U.S., the voting age was lowered from 21 to 18 by the 26th Amendment to the Constitution. That was in 1971.
Today, many young people are showing a strong interest in civic engagement. But they’re not able to vote. Some cities and towns in the U.S. allow 16-year-olds to vote in smaller elections. In several places in Maryland, for example, kids that age can vote in local elections. In 2019, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected an amendment proposing that the voting age be lowered to 16.
Here, TFK Kid Reporters Sophia Hou and Miguel Madero debate whether the voting age in the U.S. should be lowered. What do you think?

Yes!
By Sophia Hou, 11
Short Hills, New Jersey
Lowering the voting age to 16 would be good for democracy. It would increase civic engagement at an earlier age. Young people would be more interested in learning about issues that affect their community and the world if they knew their voices would be heard sooner. They’d want to be involved in shaping their future and would be more likely to become lifelong voters.
Young people might have different opinions from adults. Different perspectives are valuable. They can open people’s minds to novel ideas that can change the world. If the voting age were lowered, it would shed light on new ideas. Everyone’s voice, including young people’s, should count at election time. After all, isn’t that what a democracy is supposed to be about?

No!
By Miguel Madero, 10
San Antonio, Texas
Before the Vietnam War, the voting age was 21. When 18-year-olds went to war, they said that if they were old enough to fight for their country, they should be able to vote. The country changed its rules, and the voting age became 18. Now there are people who say it should be 17 or 16. The argument is, if they can drive, they can vote. 
I don’t think they should lower the voting age again. Voting is a right, but it is also a responsibility. A 16-year-old does not have the same maturity as an 18-year-old. They might vote for someone because he or she is popular. They might not realize how much an election can affect the country. Maybe they won’t even be informed or interested enough to vote. So I think the voting age should stay where it is.
The next debate! Do we still need movie theaters? Email your opinion to tfkeditors@time.com by October 23. Your response might be featured in an upcoming issue.

A horse named Kurt was born in Texas on August 6. Kurt made history. He’s the first Przewalski’s horse to be successfully cloned.
In 1980, scientists at the San Diego Zoo, in California, took DNA from a Przewalski’s horse and froze it. DNA is the substance that determines the characteristics of a living thing. Kurt was cloned from this DNA.
The scientists’ goal is to save the species. Przewalski’s horses, which come from Central Asia, are endangered.
The zoo worked with Revive & Restore, a wildlife conservation group. Ryan Phelan is that group’s executive director. She says cloning “can save species” and the “genetic diversity that would have otherwise been lost to time.”
Kurt will live at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park.

Time flies! The first issue of TIME for Kids was published in September 1995. That means TFK is turning 25. To honor our 25th anniversary, we’re pulling TFK stories from the archives and highlighting them in this space. Each archival issue relates to something in the news today. We hope these stories provide background for the things you’ll read about.

This week, TFK explores efforts to protect birds from the dangers of glass. Glass collisions are especially common during the fall migration season. That’s when many types of birds fly south for the winter. 
This isn’t the first time TFK has written about creatures who need help to complete their migrations. On September 30, 2011, we wrote about monarch butterflies. The insects migrate each spring and fall. At the time, scientists told TFK that chemicals were destroying milkweed, a plant monarchs depend on for survival. An expert noted that people who want to help butterflies can “plant milkweeds, or maintain areas where the plant can grow.” Good ideas! People can still follow those tips to help butterflies.

448,448,Let's Talk! With Amy Timberlake,"{'Books', 'Time Off'}","
TFK Kid Reporter Pranav Mukhi spoke with Amy Timberlake, author of the new book Skunk and Badger. Here’s part of their conversation.
1. What inspired you to write Skunk and Badger?
I was working on another book. As research, I was reading all these books on toy bears and bear mythologies, like Winnie-the-Pooh. I started to wonder: “If I wrote a book like Winnie-the-Pooh, what would it be like? What kind of story would that be?” That got me thinking.
2. Did you like stories when you were a kid?
My dad and mom read our stories out loud. I loved hearing stories aloud. When I started writing Skunk and Badger, I was thinking about how I could tell a story that could be read aloud. Like, open it up, and if you read it, you could sound brilliant. So I put in sound effects.
3. The book is about an unlikely friendship. What made you want to write that?
Sometimes, relationships get tricky. With two people, the closer you get, there comes a point where there’s something about them that bothers you. In Skunk and Badger, someone comes with all these chickens. Do you want to be friends with the person with the chickens? You could say, “It’s fine, I’ll be their friend”—or that it’s a deal-breaker, they have to move out. I’ve found that if you have more friends, you will find that your life is better.
4. What is your favorite genre to write in?
Fiction is my favorite. I love making up stories. It’s fun. And with fiction, you have opportunities to discover truth, which is different from facts. Facts are part of truth. But there’s a truth when you’re telling a story that’s really wonderful.
5. What do you do when you aren’t writing?
I read a lot of books and knit. I love to walk with my husband. We have done really long walks that we’d love to do again. We walked across England!

449,449,TFK Kid Reporters: Meet Kyle,"{'People', 'Community'}","
Meet Kyle Romain, one of the 10 outstanding kids selected to be a TFK Kid Reporter this school year. Kyle is 10 years old and lives in New Orleans, Louisiana. He spends his free time playing video games and basketball, and wants to be a scientist one day.
Finalists in the TFK Kid Reporter contest were judged on a number of factors. One of their assignments was to write an article about a hometown hero. Kyle’s story is about David Green, who runs a tandem-bike program for the visually impaired. You can read it below. We’ll be introducing the rest of the TFK Kid Reporter squad throughout September. 

One Saturday a month, the sighted world and the visually impaired world meet. The common factor: a bike. David Green works at Lighthouse Louisiana, an organization that provides jobs to people who have disabilities. He runs a tandem-bike program for the visually impaired.
“Before losing sight, I always rode a bike,” Green says. “It was one of my favorite pastimes. After riding a tandem with a sighted friend, I thought, ‘Wow. I lost my sight and I can still get the sensation of riding a bike.’ I wanted to share this gift with other people who are blind.”
Green lost his sight to a degenerative condition called Retinitis pigmentosa. It’s a hereditary eye disease that affects the retina and causes night blindness and peripheral vision loss. 
Green may not have sight, but he has a vision. He challenges individuals with visual impairments to live an active lifestyle. For each meet, Green orchestrates a different route for riders to enjoy. 
When participants arrive, they can expect to explore the city using many sensory skills. Green chooses locations where participants can encounter what the city has to offer by touch, smell, and hearing. “I make sure to create routes where we stop at local landmarks that our riders with visual impairments can meaningfully experience,” he says.
Elizabeth McDonald is a veteran pilot for the program. She met Green through the app Be My Eyes, which assists those with vision loss by providing verbal descriptions in real time.
After McDonald connected with Green, he invited her to ride one Saturday. “It opened my eyes to an amazing opportunity for people with visual impairments,” she says. “I met so many amazing people with vision loss who were getting on a bike, something I didn’t consider would be possible.”
Besides giving those with visual impairments the freedom to ride, Green advocates to make city streets safer. He is the face of self-determination. “It would have been easy for David to be insulated after he lost his vision,” McDonald says. “But he used it to think about challenges to his new community and enabled others through his work.” 
Green is a true hometown hero for the city. He makes the visually impaired in New Orleans feel as if they can do anything on two wheels. Jemell Marsalis, an experienced participant who’s blind, expresses his enthusiasm for the program: “I love being able to get out and ride just like everyone else.”

450,450,TFK Kid Reporters: Meet Rory,"{'People', 'Community'}","
Meet Rory Hu, one of the 10 outstanding kids selected to be a TFK Kid Reporter this school year. Rory is 10 years old and lives in Cupertino, California. She loves the musical Hamilton and hopes one day to interview its creator, Lin-Manuel Miranda.
Finalists in the TFK Kid Reporter contest were judged on a number of factors. One of their assignments was to write an article about a hometown hero. Rory’s piece is about a woman who has helped rescue nearly 600 dogs. You can read it below. We’ll be introducing the rest of the TFK Kid Reporter squad throughout September.

Joye Hawkes has saved nearly 600 lives in the past 16 years. No, she’s not a medical doctor, firefighter, or lifeguard. The California resident has been fighting on a different front line. Hawkes rescues and finds new homes for German shepherds.
A crisis has been looming over animal shelters. Many people are unaware that 6 million to 8 million animals enter shelters in America each year. Almost half of them are euthanized, or put to sleep, due to shelters’ lack of capacity and resources. This fact prompts many volunteers to action. Hawkes is one of the most dedicated among them.
Hawkes joined German Shepherd Rescue of Northern California (GSRNC) in 2004. She’s one of the longest-serving members of the all-volunteer organization. Each day, Hawkes juggles different tasks: evaluating and training dogs, and providing them with medical care, suitable homes, post-adoption aid, and more. 
The work Hawkes does is time-consuming, challenging, and emotionally draining. Heartbreak is a regular part of the job, as when limited resources force her to decide which dogs to save. But the emotional roller coaster she rides carries her back up each time a rescue is successfully completed, and it is these gratifying moments that keep Hawkes going. “The memories I have of these dogs are what motivate me to continue my efforts,” she says. “I consider them all my kids. They are my responsibility, and their future depends on our doing our jobs to the best of our ability.”
Hawkes has rescued more dogs than other GSRNC volunteer, according to Lani Christianson, the organization’s president. “[Hawkes] is invaluable to GSRNC,” she says. “She has gone above and beyond, putting heart, soul, time, energy, and money into rescuing as many German shepherds as she can.” 
Hawkes’s devotion could not be deterred even by COVID-19. Working in a mask, she applied herself ever more diligently to surging adoption applications. “Of course I have concerns,” Hawkes says. “But the job needs to be done.”
A family in Boulder Creek, California, is extremely grateful that Hawkes brought 3-year-old Persephone into their lives. “[She] instantly knew Persephone was the dog for us,” mom Heidi Curto says. “She would never have been a dog I picked but Joye just knew.” Persephone has since become an essential piece in the family puzzle. The joy she brought to them has softened the impact of the quarantine.
While it’s easy to do just one good deed, it’s heroic to do 600. As GSRNC treasurer Joan Hoover says, “Joye seeks no recognition. She’s rewarded every time a [German shepherd] finds a good home. So yes, she is a true hero.”

451,451,On the March,"{'United States', 'History'}","
On August 28, thousands gathered in Washington, D.C., for the March on Washington 2020. They were protesting the unjust treatment of Black people. For months, marches have taken place in the United States. They started after a man named George Floyd was killed by police in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in May.
“Equality is why we are here today,” Yolanda Renee King told the crowd. “We stand and march for love. And we will fulfill my grandfather’s dream.” 
Yolanda is 12. She’s the granddaughter of Martin Luther King Jr. She spoke on the same date that King gave his “I Have a Dream” speech, 57 years ago. That was during the 1963 March on Washington, a milestone in the struggle for civil rights. 
Like the 1963 march, this year’s march attracted a  group of all ages, including kids. Young people have played an important role in the civil rights movement for decades. They continue to be leaders in the fight for .

A Look at History 
In May 1963, thousands of Black kids in Birmingham, Alabama, joined the Children’s Crusade. They walked out of school to protest . They marched, singing, “I ain’t gonna let nobody turn me round.”
Freeman Hrabowski was 12 at the time. He decided to march when Martin Luther King Jr. visited his church. King asked kids for their help. “He believed in us, that we had a role to play,” Hrabowski told TIME for Kids.
Hrabowski’s parents let him march. They were aware of the dangers that existed at the time. But they felt it was worth the risk. Some of the marchers were arrested. They spent a few days in jail. Hrabowski was one of them. 
The march worked. Americans watched it on television. They saw how police treated kids in Birmingham. “More people began to talk about how bad things were,” Hrabowski says.

The civil rights movement gained support. The 1963 March on Washington took place a few months later. It drew 250,000 people. It pushed the U.S. Congress to outlaw  against Black people.
Positive Change 
Americans are still fighting racism. And children are still speaking out. Kids’ marches have taken place in cities all over the country, including Kirkwood, Missouri; New Orleans, Louisiana; and North Las Vegas, Nevada. 
Aidan Carter is 10 years old. He’s in fifth grade. Aidan’s mom let him organize a march in Portland, Oregon, in June.
Portland has seen many protests lately. Some of the protests have turned violent. But Aidan’s march was different. Many of the hundreds who joined him were kids. They came with their families. Some rode bikes. Bullhorn in hand, Aidan led the crowd in a chant: “Black Lives Matter.” 
“I felt like one of the big people,” Aidan says. “Even though you’re little, you can still be brave and stand up for rights.”

Aidan’s mom, Alisha Carter, is proud of her son. “Sometimes, you have to do tough things to help your community,” she says. “It’s important for Aidan to see that he can make a positive change.”
Speaking Up
Also in June, hundreds of young people attended a kids’ march in Saint Paul, Minnesota. Baylor Peterson, 11, joined in with her parents and sister. “Little kids are smart enough to see that racism is not okay,” Baylor says. 
Saunya Peterson is Baylor’s mom. “We want our daughters to be aware of the  they carry [as white people],” she says. “They should use their voice and power to help others.”
Maggie Barnes organized the march. She owns a day-care center in Saint Paul. She wanted to give kids a safe way to voice their feelings. “Children have a lot to say, if they’re given a chance,” Barnes says. “They have a right to be seen, to be heard.” 

Better Tomorrow
The kids’ marches, and the March on Washington 2020, remind Freeman Hrabowski of something Martin Luther King Jr. told him and other young protesters in 1963: “Tomorrow can be better than today.” For Hrabowski, that has proven true.

“In the 1960s, I could not have imagined seeing large numbers of families who were not Black out protesting and saying, ‘Black Lives Matter,’” he says. “That’s not something we should take for granted.”
Art for Justice
Taking part in a march or large protest isn’t the only way to fight for equality. Some kids write letters to local and national leaders. Others raise money to support groups that help people. Lately, some young people have been using art as a form of protest. Kids all over the country are showing support for social-justice issues by writing messages with sidewalk chalk. It’s a quieter way to protest that can still make a big impression.

The number of new COVID-19 cases reported daily in the United States is falling. That’s according to Johns Hopkins University. By the end of August, about 43,000 new cases were being reported daily in the U.S. That number was down 21% from the early part of the month. 
“It’s profoundly hopeful news,” Dr. Monica Gandhi told the AP. She teaches medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. Gandhi says the numbers have gone down for a reason. More people understand how the virus spreads. And more people are wearing masks. 
Still, the U.S. has reached 6 million confirmed cases of COVID-19. That’s more than any other country. 
Dr. Jonathan Quick told the AP that the drop in U.S. cases is a “good trend, but nowhere near what we need [it] to be.” Quick works with the Rockefeller Foundation. He says more testing is needed. This can help scientists trace the spread of the virus. And that could help prevent it from spreading further.

Meet Afton Campbell, one of the 10 outstanding kids selected to be a TFK Kid Reporter this school year. Afton is 12 years old and lives in Surprise, Arizona. She loves to cook and play the piano. Afton also enjoys reading books, and aspires to be an author. 
Finalists in the TFK Kid Reporter contest were judged on a number of factors. One of their assignments was to write an article about a hometown hero. Afton’s story is about an organization that donates duffel bags full of gifts to children in foster care. You can read it below. We’ll be introducing the rest of the TFK Kid Reporter squad throughout September.

Imagine you have two belongings, and you keep them in a trash bag. 
This is often a reality among the more than 400,000 foster kids in the United States. 
Darin and Kara Moss are changing that. “We started doing foster care about 10 years ago,” Darin says. “We’ve had over 25 different children through our home, and most of them came to us with hardly anything. I decided there’s got to be a better way for [foster] kids to be traveling around.”  
This decision led to the creation of their nonprofit organization, A Mighty Change of Heart, or AMCHAZ, in 2016. AMCHAZ packs and delivers personalized duffel bags stuffed with toys, books, and hygiene items to foster children in Arizona. When requesting a bag on the AMCHAZ website, foster parents list a few of the child’s favorite things. 
AMCHAZ has delivered 4,502 duffel bags so far. “Nobody gets paid, we’re all volunteers, so we don’t do this for the money, we don’t do this for the glory,” Darin says. “But it is so nice to hear from the kids and how excited they are when they get their duffel bag with their name embroidered on it. Most of these kids have never had something that is their own possession because they’ve been bouncing from house to house forever.”
Hope*, 9, and Israel*, 8, received bags from AMCHAZ. Hope says, “My favorite part was my soft stuffed animal and my water bottle.”
Israel had a harder time choosing: “I loved all of it because it was like they knew everything I liked, even my favorite color.” 
Nicole Becerra has been fostering children for three years. Each of her foster children has received a bag. “It really is a thoughtful, mindful bag that you would feel like the child’s own grandma had made for them,” she says. “So much thought, love, and care go into it.”
That care is important. Kara Moss says, “The best part of what we do, for me, would be seeing the kids receive their bags and knowing the stuff they have is theirs and theirs alone. It’s new, and it’s not a hand-me-down, and it was hand-picked for them.” 
Even kids can make a difference as volunteers at AMCHAZ. “They’ve stocked shelves, they’ve packed bags,” Kara says. “I know a couple of them have even been able to go with us when we deliver bags, which is super cool.”
AMCHAZ strives to give foster children something of their own. As Darin says, “We want them to know they are loved, and they are not forgotten.”

Finalists in the TFK Kid Reporter contest were judged on a number of factors. One of their assignments was to write an article about a hometown hero. Pranav’s story is about kids who started a fundraising event in his community. You can read it below. We’ll be introducing the rest of the TFK Kid Reporter squad throughout September. 

“Lemonade stand, lemonade stand!” shouted kids from the “S Section” of Stony Brook, a town on Long Island, New York.
It was a scorching afternoon in the summer of 2012 when 11-year-old Maddie Mastriano and her 8-year-old brother, Joseph, set up a lemonade stand with several other children on their block. After hours of selling lemonade, the group earned $15. “Instead of trying to split $15 among 20 kids, we decided to donate it somewhere,” Joseph says. “Maddie and I talked about it and decided on Stony Brook Children’s Hospital.”
Maddie and Joseph donated to the Child Life Program at Stony Brook Children’s. “We oversee all of the services that help kids cope with illness and hospitalization,” says Joan Alpers, the Child Life Program director. “Our medicine, so to speak, is to help children take hospitalization—a really strange and sometimes scary experience—and feel like they are able to master it and learn from it.”
Little did Maddie and Joseph know that their donations to the Child Life Program would grow to more than $100,000 in eight years. The original S Section Kids Lemonade Stand is now known as the Three Village Kids Lemonade Stand, a popular community event hosted every summer at R.C. Murphy Junior High School, in the Three Village Central School District.
To raise awareness of their cause, Maddie and Joseph use social media. They created a wildly popular trend in the Three Village community called the Easy Peasy Lemon Squeezy challenge. Participants must bite into a lemon and nominate others to do the same. Thanks to this idea, donations skyrocketed. Neil M., a student at Ward Melville High School, did the challenge with his marching band. “To me, the challenge is a reminder that students in the Three Village community are involved and love to give back,” Neil says.
Megan S., a Ward Melville alumna, agrees. “I participated in this challenge with the Key Club two years in a row,” she says. “It always feels good to see a peer helping the community, so it was super inspiring.”

Esteban Tarango, 12, was excited to make new friends when he started middle school this year in Tempe, Arizona. Instead, his school year kicked off in front of a computer screen. “I’m honestly kind of sad,” Esteban told TIME for Kids. “I feel like I’m missing out.”
The back-to-school experience has been  for students everywhere. That’s because of the coronavirus pandemic. As of mid-July, school closures had affected more than a billion students worldwide. That’s according to United Nations secretary-general António Guterres. In an August 4 video message, he said the pandemic “has led to the largest disruption of education ever.”

In the United States, many schools have reopened with remote learning only. But some schools have brought students back into the classroom. Others are offering a mix of online and in-person instruction.
Life at school today looks very different. Schools are sanitizing often. Temperature checks are common. There are many new rules to follow. 

“We’ll have to wear a mask,” Mia Westerman told TFK over the summer. She’s a sixth-grade student in Clarksburg, West Virginia. “We’ll have to social-distance,” she added. “And we’re not allowed to change classes or eat in the cafeteria.”
The Big Picture 
COVID-19 was first discovered in 2019. It’s the disease caused by the new coronavirus. Recent studies show young people are less likely to get seriously sick from the virus. But kids can spread the virus to others. Staying home is one way to slow the spread of the disease.

Decisions about how and when to reopen schools are being made on a case-by-case basis. They’re constantly reevaluated by local officials and leaders. The virus is so new that our understanding of it is always changing. Plus, it is better controlled in some parts of the country than in others. 
“It depends on where you are,” Dr. Anthony Fauci said, when asked if kids should be back in classrooms. Fauci is the nation’s top infectious-disease expert. He spoke with the Washington Post, in a July 24 interview. “We live in a very large country,” Fauci added. 

No Easy Solution
Should kids be learning virtually or in the classroom? There’s no easy answer to this question. In-person learning would help the economy. It would allow some parents to go back to work. Even so, remote learning is the safest option in many places for now.  
But learning away from teachers and classmates is difficult. The isolation is having an effect on kids’ mental health. 

The pandemic has also created greater inequalities. Kids who rely on school for some of their meals might not have enough to eat. And some students don’t have access to computers or reliable Internet. They’re having a harder time getting their work done.
There’s so much uncertainty in the world right now. But one thing is for sure: You and your classmates are part of history. Years from now, kids will learn about the coronavirus pandemic. They’ll be curious about your experience. And they’ll see you and your classmates as incredibly .

459,459,Meet the Candidates,"{'Government', 'Election 2020'}","
The Democratic and Republican Parties have officially named their candidates for president and vice president of the United States. The announcements were made at political conventions. These took place in late August.
Joe Biden is the Democratic Party’s nominee for president. He accepted the nomination at the Democratic National Convention. “If you entrust me with the presidency, I will draw on the best of us,” Biden said. Kamala Harris is the party’s vice-presidential nominee. She is a California senator.
President Donald Trump is the Republican Party’s presidential nominee. He is running for reelection. Mike Pence is his vice-presidential running mate. During the Republican National Convention, on August 24, Trump gave a speech. “This is the most important election in the history of our country,” he said. Three days later, he accepted the nomination with a speech from the White House.
Both conventions were different from those held in the past. Usually, there are huge crowds. But COVID-19 made that unsafe. This year, the conventions were held mainly online.

462,462,Animals Decide,"{'Science', 'Animals'}","
This year, Americans will vote to decide who will be president. But humans aren’t the only creatures who vote. Other animals make group decisions. They just do it differently. And they do it for different reasons. 
Instead of voting for a president, animals vote on where to live or when to hunt. For years, scientists have studied animals’ voting patterns. They have learned how these patterns affect collective decisions.
Meerkat Call 
Scientists compare how people and animals make choices. Take meerkats, for example. 
“Meerkats, like humans, negotiate about decisions,” Marta Manser told TIME for Kids. She’s an animal-behavior scientist at the University of Zurich, in Switzerland. She and other scientists studied meerkats in South Africa. They found that the animals  together. They did this for protection. But what if a meerkat wanted to speed up the search? The animal would make a “move call.” If three or more meerkats made this call, the group sped up. 
Humans make decisions like this too. Manser says, “If you have a group of people, and one person says, ‘Let’s go for pizza,’ and no one agrees, then nothing is going to happen.” But, she says, if more people say they want pizza, then the whole group will probably go for it. 
Bless You!
African wild dogs in Botswana vote too. A 2017 study published in Proceedings of the Royal Society B found that after socializing, the pack decided whether to hunt. How did the dogs cast a vote to hunt? They sneezed! “Whether the dogs would actually go on a hunt was decided by the number of sneezes,” Andrew King says. King cowrote the study. The more sneezes, the more likely it was that the pack would hunt.
Animals don’t always agree with one another. But making group decisions helps ensure survival. “It is fascinating to see how animals reach a ,” King says.

Alexis Bumah, 12, puts on her mom’s work headset. At her home in Dayton, Ohio, Alexis can hear the voice of Eshaan Mani. Eshaan, 14, is calling in from Houston, Texas. The TFK Kid Reporters are about to cohost the  of a new podcast series, TIME for Kids Explains.
Over three days of recording sessions in April, Alexis and Eshaan interviewed a journalist and talked about current events. They also played a game and recorded silly sound effects. It was “a lot of fun,” Alexis says.
Anne Richards works for Pinna, a company that makes podcasts for kids. She’s the executive producer of TIME for Kids Explains. After editing the pilot, Richards tested it with kids. “That helped us in figuring out how we wanted to shape the series,” she says.
The result? A weekly news show that’s different from other podcasts. “It’s kids talking to kids, not kids being talked at by a bunch of adults,” Richards says. “It’s a really interesting, , different way to hear about what’s going on.”
A New Way to Learn
Each week this year, the Pinna team will work with TFK Kid Reporters. They’ll record and edit an episode of TIME for Kids Explains. The kids will conduct interviews and dive deeper into stories from the magazine.
Andrea Delbanco is TFK’s editor in chief. “We’re excited that, in addition to the stories that we write, there’s a way for kids to listen to and learn about the news,” she says. Delbanco adds that the podcast will make TFK more  for kids who are visually impaired or who have trouble reading.
According to Eshaan, TIME for Kids Explains is a great series for kids who haven’t listened to podcasts before. “I wasn’t a big podcast person” before cohosting the show, he says. “But my interest grew, and now podcasts have almost become part of my routine.”
Alexis shares his enthusiasm. “Listen to our podcast because it’s so upbeat,” she says. “You can paint a picture in your mind of what’s going on as we explain it.”

Author Donna Barba Higuera says that some things about Lupe, like her hatred of square dancing, were inspired by Higuera’s two daughters. Others, like Lupe’s Mexican heritage and love of baseball, come from the author herself. Still some things are unique to Lupe. “Once I started writing her, she took on a life of her own,” Higuera says.

Michelle Robinson was born in 1964. She grew up on the South Side of Chicago in a tiny apartment. Her family was very close and ate dinner together as often as possible. Michelle and her brother were allowed to watch one hour of television each night. They spent the rest of their free time playing board games or chasing each other around the house. They loved to spray furniture polish on the wood floor so that they could slide faster in their socks.
Michelle’s father worked at the city’s water plant. He started as a janitor and went on to become a manager. Even when he developed multiple sclerosis and struggled to walk, he kept working. Michelle’s mother taught her to read before Michelle started kindergarten. Michelle began taking piano lessons when she was just 4 years old. She quickly discovered that the more she practiced, the more she improved. 

Michelle liked school and did well. From sixth to eighth grade, she took advanced classes with kids who worked at their own pace. Being with other talented students motivated Michelle, who kept track of how she was doing compared to her classmates. The competition felt like a game, and Michelle liked to win.
When Michelle was ready for high school, she tested into the Whitney M. Young Magnet High School, which attracts talented students from all over the city. It took Michelle an hour and a half to get to school by bus. She used the time to study, which helped her excel and graduate in the top 10% of her class as a member of the National Honor Society. 

For college, Michelle set her sights on Princeton. When her high school counselor doubted Michelle’s ability to get into the school, Michelle was deter-mined to prove her wrong. She wrote a compelling college entrance essay that earned her a spot at the prestigious university. As always, Michelle’s hard work was the key to her success.

468,468,This is Stephanie: Read the Story of Stephanie Kwolek,"{'People', 'History'}","
Stephanie Louise Kwolek was born in the small town of New Kensington, Pennsylvania, in 1923. Her parents were Polish immigrants. Stephanie’s school was so small that two grades were taught in one classroom. 
Stephanie was different from her classmates. She was an excellent reader with an exceptional memory. She could commit pages and pages of information to memory. She was also very good at math. The older kids in her class got annoyed when she knew answers that they didn’t. 

Stephanie’s love of learning came from her father. Every night when he came home from work, he sat and read a book or newspaper. He was an amateur naturalist—a scientist who studies nature. He encouraged Stephanie to explore the great outdoors. Together, they walked in the woods, collecting leaves, flowers, and seeds. Stephanie stuck her finds in a scrapbook. Her father helped her label and write descriptions of them. He died when she was 10, but their early explorations together inspired Stephanie to pursue a career in science. 
Stephanie’s mother, a seamstress, inspired Stephanie’s creativity. She copied her mother’s sewing patterns to make costumes for paper dolls. Sometimes, she used the sewing maching when her mother wasn’t looking. Stephanie liked working with fabric, and she was good at it. She thought about a career in fashion design. 
As Stephanie grew older, she decided she wanted to use science to help people and decided to become a doctor. She studied chemistry in college, but when she graduated, she couldn’t afford to go to medical school. Instead, she worked and saved money. She got a job as a chemist at the DuPont company. The job was supposed to be temporary, but Stephanie fell in love with it and never looked back. Her work at DuPont combined her childhood love of science and fabric with her interest in helping people and solving problems, and her creations would change the world.  
Discovering Kevlar
At DuPont, Stephanie joined the Pioneering Research Laboratory. Her team was tasked with creating a strong, lightweight fiber that would replace steel wire in tires. Stephanie was up for the challenge. She invented Kevlar fiber, which is made by spinning strands of polymer together. It’s five times stronger than steel, doesn’t rust, and makes a fabric that’s difficult to pierce. Kevlar is now used in more than 200 products, including spacecraft, cell phones, and bulletproof vests and helmets. It revolutionized equipment for soldiers and first responders. 

 
Stephanie’s invention has saved countless lives. She spent her life researching and teaching people about her work, and was a strong advocate for women in science.
Fast Facts
At Carnegie Mellon University, Stephanie was inspired by chemistry professor Clara Miller.Stephanie entered the workforce in 1946. More women were being hired then because many men were still in the military overseas after World War II. When Stephanie applied to work at DuPont, they said it would take weeks for an answer. She said she had another offer to consider and they offered her the job on the spot.Stephanie spent her free time teaching children and mentoring female scientists.She won numerous awards for discovering Kevlar, such as the Perkin Medal, in 1997.

Rosa McCauley was born in Tuskegee, Alabama, in 1913. When she was 2, her parents separated. Rosa moved with her mother to Pine Level, Alabama, to live with her grandparents. Rosa’s mother taught school in another town. She was able to come home to see her children only on weekends.
Rosa missed her mother, but she loved being with her grand-parents. From her grandfather, she learned how to plant corn and milk cows. Her grand-mother taught her how to cook and make quilts.

Rosa’s grandparents also taught her about racism. In the American South, laws kept Black people separate from white people. Black people had to use separate entrances, drink from separate fountains, and go to separate schools and hospitals. Sometimes, groups of white men attacked Black people. They set fire to Black homes, churches, and schools. Rosa’s grandfather had to board up the family’s windows so no one could break in. Rosa learned to be brave.
When Rosa was 6, she went to the elementary school for Black children in Pine Level. Rosa and her classmates had to walk to school, no matter how far away they lived. White children rode a school bus. Sometimes, white children threw things at Rosa and her friends from the bus.

Pine Level had no junior high or high school for Black children, so Rosa’s mother sent her to a school in Montgomery. All the girls there were Black. The teachers were white. Rosa had always obeyed the rules and took care to avoid trouble. But one day, she was walking along the street and a white boy threatened her. Rosa threatened him back. The boy’s mother was upset and talked about having Rosa put in jail. Luckily, that didn’t happen. 
As Rosa grew up, she made the decision to not let racism make her act out in anger ever again. Still, she knew that things weren’t fair, and it bothered her.
Rosa Refuses

In 1955, Rosa Parks was arrested for sitting on a bus. As in many cities in the South, the buses in Montgomery, Alabama, were segregated. Black people had to sit at the back. If a white person wanted to sit, a Black person had to give up his or her seat. On December 1, Rosa refused to get up. She was arrested. Many claimed Rosa was just tired. But she was a member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). It was a deliberate protest.
Her arrest caused a bus boycott in Montgomery. The boycott lasted for more than a year. A federal court and the Supreme Court ruled against segregated buses. Rosa’s actions inspired many other battles against unfair laws.

Rosa married a man named Raymond Parks in 1932. He worked as a barber in Montgomery At age 16, Rosa dropped out of high school to care for her sick grandmother and mother. A few years later, she returned and got her diploma.In 1996, Rosa received the Presidential Medal of Freedom. It’s the highest award a civilian can get.  In 1999, TIME magazine called Rosa one of the most influential people of the 20th century.There’s a statue of Rosa in the United States Capitol, in Washington D.C.

470,470,This is Grace: Read the Story of Grace Hopper,"{'People', 'History'}","
Grace Murray was born in New York City in 1906. In an era when girls were expected to play house, Grace loved climbing trees, hiking, sailing, and reading. She also played basketball, hockey, and water polo—none of which was a typical activity for girls. Grace had a dollhouse, but she was more interested in building toy furniture for it than in playing with dolls. She even built an elevator for it.

Grace liked figuring out how things worked. When she was 7, she took apart her alarm clock. Gears and cogs flew out of the clock, but she couldn’t make sense of the mechanism. Instead of giving up, she dismantled all the other alarm clocks in the house, determined to discover how they worked.
Grace’s parents encouraged her curiosity. They took her to museums, libraries, concerts, and lectures. They also spent summers near a lake, where they hiked, swam, sailed, and explored. Once, Grace’s canoe capsized. Her mother, who was watching from the shore, called out, “Remember your great-grandfather, the admiral!” This reminder gave Grace the strength to recover her canoe and return to shore. Grace would later say that her great-grandfather inspired her admiration for the U.S. Navy. 

When Grace was 8, her father became ill and had to have both legs amputated. He never complained. His bravery inspired Grace to face challenges head-on. If her father could be so brave, Grace felt that she could conquer anything. 
Grace’s father worried that he might not always be able to provide for his daughters. He wanted them to get a good education and be able to support themselves. He encouraged them to go to college and envision careers. Grace started at Vassar College when she was 17. She studied math and physics, then went to graduate school at Yale. With a PhD in mathematics, the little girl who’d spent her days tinkering with clocks would become one of the greatest computer minds of her generation.
Leader in Coding
After graduating from Yale, Grace wanted to join the U.S. Naval Reserve. In 1943, she was accepted, and assigned to the Bureau of Ships Computation Project, at Harvard University. There, she worked on the first large-scale automatic calculator in the U.S. Her team came up with new ways to interact with computer data. Grace believed the data should be similar to human language. Later, she helped develop a computer language called COBOL, which uses English words. 

Grace was a pioneer in computer science. At a time when women were rarely seen in STEM fields, she worked with other experts to develop computer programming as it’s known today.

471,471,This is Amelia: Read the Story of Amelia Earhart,"{'People', 'History'}","
Amelia Earhart, known as Meelie when she was a child, loved to be swept away on adventures. Her father was a lawyer who worked for the Rock Island Railroad in Kansas City, Missouri. As the daughter of a railroad employee, Amelia got to travel all over the country and see amazing sights. 

When she was 7 years old, Amelia visited the 1904 World’s Fair, in St. Louis, Missouri. Inspired by a roller coaster there, she decided to build one herself. She enlisted the help of her younger sister, Muriel, nicknamed Pidge. Meelie and Pidge gathered planks, a wooden box, and a tub of lard to grease the tracks. They built their roller coaster off the roof of a tool-shed. Amelia took the first ride—and crash-landed. Despite the bruises, she loved the experience, and told Pidge it felt like flying.
Amelia first saw an air-plane in person when she was 10. It was at a state fair in Des Moines, Iowa. She wasn’t too impressed: “It was a thing of rusty wire and wood and looked not at all interesting,” she said.
Another airplane she saw was a bit more exciting. Around 1918, she and a friend attended a f lying exposition in Toronto, Canada. While they were watching a pilot perform stunts, he suddenly dove right at them. “I am sure he said to himself, ‘Watch me make them scamper,’” Amelia recalled. She held her ground as the airplane swooped by. 

Amelia wasn’t sure what she wanted to do for her career. She nursed wounded World War I soldiers, trained to be a mechanic, and studied medicine and medical research. When she was 23, she attended an air show that offered plane rides. Amelia jumped at the chance, and flew in an air-plane for the first time.
When the plane got a few hundred feet off the ground, Amelia was filled with exhilaration. At that moment, she knew flying was exactly what she was meant to do.

Famous Flier
Amelia Earhart is one of the most celebrated pilots of all time. She made history with her aviation feats.

In 1928, she became the first woman to fly across the Atlantic Ocean. That flight made her famous, but she’d been only a passenger. In 1932, she set off on another flight—this time in the pilot’s seat. When she landed, 14 hours and 56 minutes later, she was the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic. Three years later, she became the first person to fly solo from Hawaii to California.
Amelia inspired generations of girls. “Women must try to do things as men have tried,” she said. “When they fail, their failure must be but a challenge to others.”

Fast Facts
Amelia’s first plane was bright yellow. She named it The Canary.In 1933, she created a clothing line. Some of the pieces were made from parachute silk or from the fabric then used for airplane wings.Amelia helped found an organization for women pilots called the Ninety-Nines. It’s still active. She wrote three books about her flights, plus numerous articles for magazines and newspapers.In 1937, Earhart took off on a flight around the world. She’d traveled more than 22,000 miles when she disappeared. She was never found.

472,472,This is Patsy: Read the Story of Patsy Takemoto Mink,"{'People', 'History'}","
Patsy Takemoto Mink was born on the island of Maui, in Hawaii, in 1927. Her family lived on a sugar plantation, where her father worked as a civil engineer and surveyor. Patsy inherited his curiosity. And she couldn’t help but notice the racial prejudice around her.

Patsy’s family was of Japanese ancestry. There were people from many different countries and cultures in Hawaii, but white families of European ancestry were treated as a ruling class. Plantation workers were seen as part of a lower class. Patsy’s parents weren’t field workers, but racial prejudice affected her family. Her father, the only Japanese-American manager at the plantation, wasn’t promoted. White engineers with less experience got the better jobs. 
In fourth grade, Patsy went to a mostly white school. She found it to be an unfriendly place, and she felt this was because she wasn’t a white person of European ancestry. Patsy thought it was wrong to judge people by their race. She was lonely. But her brother made sure to include her in his baseball and football games. Patsy was an enthusiastic athlete and loved playing with the boys.
When Patsy was growing up, Hawaii was a United States territory, not a state. That meant the citizens of Hawaii had almost no representation in the federal government, and they couldn’t vote for the U.S. president. This didn’t seem right to many Hawaiians.

Patsy made friends at Maui High School, which had a more diverse student body. In 1941, when she was 14, Japan attacked the Pearl Harbor naval base, in Hawaii, and the U.S. entered World War II. Because Japan was an enemy, Japanese Hawaiians were treated badly. But Patsy was still popular. In her senior year, she ran for student body president and won. Patsy was the first girl to serve as student body president at her high school. It was the first of many elections she would win.

When Hawaii became a state, Patsy ran for Congress. In 1964, she won a seat representing Hawaii in the U.S. House of Representatives. She became the first woman of color and the first Asian-American woman to be elected to Congress. She would go on to serve 12 terms.

Patsy fought for equality and education reform. She cowrote the Title IX law, which passed in 1972. This made it illegal to discriminate against a person in educational programs or activities on the basis of sex. Today, it ensures equal opportunities for women in sports and protects many students from discrimination. When Patsy died in 2002, Title IX was renamed the Patsy Takemoto Mink Equal Opportunity in Education Act.

473,473,This is Simone: Read the Story of Simone Biles,"{'People', 'History'}","
Simone Biles was a bright, bubbly, bouncy little girl. She couldn’t sit still, and her favorite place to be was the trampoline in her grandparents’ backyard, where she flipped and twisted in the air for hours. Any move her siblings could do, she could do too. 
Simone was born in 1997. When she was 6 years old, her day-care group went on a field trip to a gym. Simone loved watching the gymnasts train and perform. She couldn’t just watch them, though—she had to try their moves. She was so good that one of the coaches sent a letter home with her, inviting Simone to take gymnastics classes. 

Simone loved the classes, and she was excellent at climbing, swinging, jumping, and tumbling. She had a lot to learn, though. Most of the gymnasts in her class had started lessons when they were toddlers. At 6, Simone was the oldest child in her class. That would change quickly.
Several times a year, the gym held exhibitions to demonstrate the gymnasts’ skills. At one of these, young gymnasts had to climb 10 feet up a rope, using just their arms and holding their legs straight in front of them. Simone was so strong that she climbed 15 or 20 feet into the air and had to be coaxed back to the ground.
The coaches could hardly keep up with Simone. When one girl performed a standing back tuck, Simone was sure she could do one too. Her coach didn’t believe her, so Simone tried the trick and nailed it on the spot. 
At 9, Simone learned why she couldn’t sit still: She had ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder). Her brain moved fast and her body did too—which made it hard for her to concentrate in school but which also made her an amazing gymnast. “The challenges we face help define who we are,” Simone wrote. “My challenge is also my superpower: ADHD.” Simone’s superpower would help make her one of the most dynamic gymnasts ever seen. 
Medal Winner
Simone is one of the greatest athletes in history. At age 16, she won two gold medals at the Artistic Gymnastics World Championships, including the all-around (the total score from competing in all events). She has now won 25 world medals, 19 of them gold. That’s the most in world gymnastics history.
Simone competed in her first Olympics in 2016. She was the first female U.S. gymnast to win four gold medals in an Olympic Games. Since then, Simone has debuted moves never successfully done in competition, including a double-double dismount from the balance beam. The move became known as the Biles. Several signature moves have been named after Simone.

Fast Facts
Simone is the most decorated female gymnast in America. One of her signature moves is a triple-double (double backflip with three twists in the air). It’s known as the Biles II. She is the first Black woman to win an Artistic Gymnastics World Championships all-around title—and she’s won this title five times. Simone is the first woman gymnast to win three consecutive all-around world titles. At the 2018 World Championships, Simone had a painful kidney stone. She still won gold and collected the all-around title.

474,474,This is Chloe: Read the Story of Chloe Kim,"{'People', 'History'}","
Chloe Kim was born in Long Beach, California, in 2000. Her parents had moved to the U.S. from South Korea, with big dreams of a new life.
When Chloe was 4, her father took her snowboarding in California’s San Gabriel Mountains. Little Chloe loved it. Her father bought her a used snowboard and padded her ski pants with cut-up yoga mats so she’d have a softer landing when she fell. 
Chloe showed real skill, and soon she began to compete. At her first big competition, her family didn’t know they needed to reserve a hotel room. When they arrived, there were no rooms, so they slept in their car. Even after a restless night, Chloe won three bronze medals.

Chloe’s athletic talent was obvious, but her parents made it clear that her education came first. For third and fourth grade, they sent her to school in Switzerland, where her aunt lived. They wanted Chloe to learn French. It wasn’t an easy time. Chloe struggled to fit in. She was an outgoing, upbeat California girl, but she was the only Asian student at her Swiss school. Classmates said mean things about her. Chloe worked extra hard to learn French so she could answer back. Once she could speak their language, the bullies were nicer to her. 
Two years later, Chloe returned to the U.S. Every weekend, her dad drove her to Mammoth Mountain, more than five hours away. They would leave at 2:00 a.m. to get there in time for practice. She later began homeschooling so she’d have more time to snowboard.
Sometimes, Chloe wanted to stay home on the weekend and see her friends, but her dad kept after her. He saw that Chloe could be a snowboarding star. The more she competed, the more Chloe realized that she loved to wow people. By the time she was a teen, she, too, had big dreams: She was going to become one of the best snowboarders in the world.
New Heights
At 14, Chloe won a gold medal at the 2015 X Games. At the time, she was the youngest winner in the history of the competition. At the 2016 U.S. Snowboarding Grand Prix, Chloe was the first woman to participate in the halfpipe and land back-to-back 1080s. The complex trick requires three full revolutions in midair. 

At 13, Chloe had qualified for the 2014 Olympics but was too young to participate. So she competed at 17, in Pyeongchang, South Korea, in 2018. Though she’d already secured gold, Chloe landed another back-to-back 1080 during her final halfpipe, making her the first woman to land this trick in an Olympic competition. She was the youngest female gold medalist on the course.

Chloe played Lady Gaga’s “Paparazzi” during her first run at the 2018 Olympics.Chloe speaks three languages: English, French, and Korean.Chloe is superstitious. Before she goes on a run, she knocks twice on her snowboard for good luck.Chloe has a sweet tooth—she adores candy. Skittles are a favorite, and she also loves tutti-frutti jelly beans.In 2019, Chloe announced that she’d take a break from professional snowboarding in order to attend Princeton University.

475,475,This is Babe: Read the Story of Babe Didrikson,"{'People', 'History'}","
Mildred Ella Didrikson was born in Texas in 1911. Her parents were from Norway. There, her mother had been known as an excellent skier and skater. 
Since she had five older siblings, Mildred was called Baby at home. To keep up, she had to be competitive. Mildred loved playing baseball with her brothers. After she hit five home runs in one game, her family began calling her Babe, after baseball great Babe Ruth. The name stayed with her all her life.
Growing up, Babe sometimes dressed in boys’ clothes. She had no interest in games like jacks or hopscotch, which were considered more girlish at the time. Babe said she wanted to be “the greatest athlete that ever lived,” even though there were few professional female sports stars in the 1920s. Her father, who was a carpenter, built a barbell out of a broomstick and old flatirons. Babe used it to strengthen her muscles. She also raced against streetcars to practice running. Soon she was beating the boys in foot races and all sorts of other games. In sandlot baseball, Babe was a powerhouse pitcher and hitter. 
“Is there anything you can’t play?” Babe is said to have been asked. “Yeah, dolls,” she replied.
Babe wasn’t a great student, but she excelled  at tennis, volleyball, baseball, swimming, diving, skating, cycling, and bowling. Her high school basketball team never lost a game while she was on the court. Her talent was spotted by the Golden Cyclones, a women’s basketball team sponsored by an insurance company. Babe, a skilled typist, left high school to work for that company as a secretary, so she could play for its sports teams. She soon became its star athlete. The company team won a national basketball championship in 1931, with Babe as its best player. 
By the age of 21, Babe had achieved her dream of becoming an athlete. She had won Olympic gold in javelin and hurdles, and silver in the high jump. But her career in sports was only just beginning.

Course Change
After her Olympic wins, Babe wanted a new challenge. She began playing golf. Babe faced gender discrimination in the sport and harsh criticism in the media. Still, she shined on the course and won 82 tournaments—including 14 in a row that still make up the longest winning streak in the sport’s history.

Babe won the U.S. Women’s Amateur Championship. She was the first American to win the British Ladies Amateur. In 1938, she competed in the traditionally all-male Los Angeles Open and became the first woman ever to play in such an event. In 1950, Babe became a founding member of the Ladies Professional Golf Association (LPGA). It’s now one of the world’s longest-running women’s professional sports associations.
Fast Facts
Babe set an Olympic or world record in every event she competed in at the 1932 games.  That same year, she was the first female Olympic champion of the javelin contest. When Babe first turned to golf, she practiced for hours. She sometimes hit as many as 1,500 balls a day. In 1938, Babe married professional wrestler George Zaharias. Babe was named the Associated Press Female Athlete of the Year six times. The AP also called her the greatest female athlete of the 20th century.

476,476,This is Misty: Read the Story of Misty Copeland,"{'People', 'History'}","
Misty Copeland grew up in Southern California in the 1980s. She had five siblings, so she often had to compete for attention. Misty was shy and quiet, but she taught herself to do cartwheels and handstands, and pretended to perform for an audience. She imagined the applause when she did all her moves just right.
In middle school, Misty decided to try out for the drill team, a type of dance group. She wanted to be captain. Her big sister had been a star on the same team, and her mom had been a professional cheerleader. Could Misty, the girl who was afraid to read aloud in class, really take center stage?

Misty did her best at the audition and wowed the coach, who had studied ballet. She knew Misty had a gift. The coach suggested Misty talk to Cindy Bradley, the ballet teacher at a Boys & Girls Club. Cindy offered Misty free ballet classes, and Misty accepted.
The classes were grueling, but every leap and spin filled Misty with joy. In two months, she was dancing on pointe—on the tips of her toes—a skill that takes most dancers years to master. A few months later, she got a lead role in The Nutcracker.
Meanwhile, Misty and her family were living in a motel room. The bus ride from there to the ballet studio took hours. Misty’s mom said Misty would have to give up the ballet lessons. Misty was devastated. Cindy asked if Misty would like to live with her during the week so she could continue her lessons and go home on weekends. Misty’s mom agreed.

Misty took advanced classes and got better and better, dazzling audiences with her skills. But she had never actually seen a live ballet performance by professional dancers until Cindy took her to watch American Ballet Theatre (ABT) perform Don Quixote. ABT was one of the top ballet companies in the world, and the main ballerina, Paloma Herrera, was only 19 when she became a star. Misty watched Paloma and dreamed of someday becoming an ABT principal dancer.
Dancing Star
Misty was the first Black woman to become a principal dancer at American Ballet Theatre. Her career at the company began in 2000, when she was invited to join its demanding training program for young dancers. In 2001, she became a member of the corps de ballet and performed in large group scenes. At the time, she was the only Black woman in the 80-person company.
With her darker skin and muscular body, Misty stood out. She didn’t let that stand her way. “You can be who you are,” she says. “You don’t have to look like the person next to you.” Misty inspired people from diverse back- grounds to take up ballet. In the dance world, there is a name for this phenomenon: the Misty Effect.

Fast Facts
Most ballet dancers begin training at a young age, but Misty didn’t take her first lesson until she was 13.Misty is involved with ABT’s Project Plié. It brings ballet training to communities where it hasn’t been available before.Misty is also an author. Her first book for kids, Firebird, is about a young dancer with brown skin.Misty appeared in a music video for Prince’s version of the song “Crimson and Clover,” in 2009.In 2012, Misty had surgery to repair a fractured bone in her left leg.

477,477,This is Wilma: Read the Story of Wilma Rudolph,"{'People', 'History'}","
Wilma Rudolph was born in 1940. The 20th of 22 children, she arrived prematurely, weighing only four and a half pounds. Many people in her small town in Tennessee didn’t think such a tiny baby would live to see her first birthday, especially in a home with no electricity or running water. But Wilma surprised them all. As soon as she could walk, she was running and jumping. 
Still, Wilma remained small and was often sick. By the time she was 5, she’d become ill with scarlet fever and polio. Back then, there was no vaccine for polio. Children with the disease often died. Wilma survived, but her left leg was twisted, and she couldn’t walk. She got around by hopping on her right leg. “My doctors told me I would never walk again,” she said. “My mother told me I would. I believed my mother.” Every week, Wilma and her mother or aunt traveled 100 miles round-trip to the closest hospital that treated Black people, so Wilma could receive treatment for her leg.

At home, Wilma did exercises every day. She felt lonely and left out. Her leg often ached, but the pain wasn’t as bad as watching her brothers and sisters go to school without her. She was determined to get stronger, so she started wearing a heavy steel brace. She hated the constant reminder that something was wrong with her, but the brace meant she could walk—and that meant she could finally go to school.
After several years of treatment, Wilma once again surprised everyone by taking off the brace and walking by herself. She had been diligently practicing with the goal of one day being able to run, jump, and play games like everyone else. And eventually, that’s exactly what she did. 
Wilma loved playing basketball and running track and field. When she was 14, the women’s track coach from Tennessee State University saw her compete. He told Wilma, the girl once unable to walk, that she had the potential to become an outstanding runner.  
Run the World

Wilma qualified for the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne, Australia. At 16, she was the youngest member of the track-and-field team. She won bronze in the 400-meter relay. Four years later, she entered the 1960 Olympics, in Rome, Italy. She became the first American woman to win three gold medals in one Olympics. These Games were the first to be broadcast on TV in North America, making Wilma a worldwide sensation. People said she was the fastest woman in the world.
When Wilma got home to Tennessee, her city wanted to hold a segregated celebration in her honor. Wilma said she’d refuse to attend. So her parade and banquet were the first integrated events in Clarksville, Tennessee.

Fast Facts
Wilma went to Tennessee State University. Now its indoor track and dormitory are named for her.Wilma had a few nicknames: Her high school basketball coach called her Skeeter, like a mosquito. After the 1960 Olympics, newspapers called her the Black Pearl and the Black Gazelle.After retiring, in 1962, Wilma became a track coach, a goodwill ambassador to French West Africa, and an activist for civil and women’s rights.Wilma published an autobiography in 1977.In the 1980s, she was inducted into the U.S. Olympic Hall of Fame, and she established the Wilma Rudolph Foundation, which supports young athletes.

478,478,This is Billie Jean: Read the Story of Billie Jean King,"{'People', 'History'}","
Billie Jean Moffitt was born in Long Beach, California, on November 22, 1943. Her whole family was athletic. Her mother swam and her father played basketball. At a time when few dads encouraged their daughters to play sports, Billie Jean’s father did. He spent as much time playing ball with her as he did with her brother. He respected their abilities equally. He also taught them to never underestimate their opponents.

Billie Jean enjoyed and excelled at many sports, including baseball. She dreamed of one day play- ing professionally. But when she went to a Major League Baseball game, she quickly realized there were no girls on the teams. Billie Jean didn’t think that was fair.
A friend introduced her to tennis when Billie Jean was 11. In the 1950s, tennis was mostly played by wealthy people, at country clubs. Billie Jean’s family was not wealthy, but she instantly liked the game. She did odd jobs for her neighbors, working hard to earn enough money to buy a racket. She also worked hard at tennis. She took free lessons at the public courts in the parks around Long Beach and told her mother she was going to become the Number 1 tennis player in the world.

Billie Jean became an excellent player and began competing in tournaments. She was just 14 when she won her first championship, in Southern California. But she realized that no matter how good she was, she was treated differently because she was a girl.
At the beginning of college, Billie Jean was ranked as the third-best player in the entire country. But because she was a woman, her school did not give her a scholarship. When Billie Jean won a tournament, she earned less money than a man would have made if he’d won. Billie Jean knew this wasn’t fair. She was more determined than ever to become the best player in the world so she could use her status to make sports equal for all.
Tennis Champ
Billie Jean got international attention in 1961, when she and her partner became the youngest pair to win the doubles title at Wimbledon, the most prestigious tournament in tennis. Five years later, she won her first singles championship at Wimbledon. She went on to win 20 Wimbledon titles—a record that hasn’t been beaten.

In 1973, men’s tennis player Bobby Riggs challenged Billie Jean to a match. Riggs claimed women could not play tennis as well as men. Billie Jean proved Riggs wrong—she beat him in all three sets. That same year, Billie Jean threatened to boycott the U.S. Open if male and female winners weren’t awarded equal prize money. This led the Open to become the first major tennis tournament that paid athletes equally.

480,480,Getting the Vote,"{'United States', 'History'}","
Next week marks 100 years since the ratification of the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The amendment, which became law on August 18, 1920, gave women in the United States the right to vote. 
The amendment came only after many years of activism by suffragists. These were people who advocated for women’s voting rights. In fact, the fight for female suffrage began soon after the U.S. became a country. 
In 1776, the Founders wrote in the Declaration of Independence that “all men are created equal.” But when the Constitution was ratified, in 1788, it gave the right to vote to white men only. 
The first convention for women’s rights was held in Seneca Falls, New York, in 1848. Sixty-eight women and 32 men signed a document: “We hold these truths to be self-evident; that all men and women are created equal.” It demanded voting rights for women. 
Members of the suffragist movement did not always agree. In 1865, the Civil War ended. It put a stop to slavery in the U.S. Suffragists began to argue about the 15th Amendment, which was ratified in 1870. It gave Black men the right to vote. Some suffragists did not support the amendment because it didn’t include women. Others argued that it could help suffragists reach their goal. 
As a result, two organizations were formed. One worked for suffrage by pressing for changes to the Constitution. The other worked to change laws in individual states. In 1890, the two groups joined forces to form the National American Woman Suffrage Association. 

Black women fought for the vote, too. They came up with strategies for the movement. They organized meetings and participated in demonstrations. But they were often excluded by white organizers. At a parade in 1913, the Black suffragist Ida B. Wells-Barnett was asked to march in the back. She refused, and marched at the front with white activists. 
In 1878, the 19th Amendment was introduced in Congress. It called for women’s suffrage. But the House of Representatives and the Senate did not pass the amendment until 1919. It then went to the states for ratification. 
On August 18, 1920, the 19th Amendment was finally signed into law. 
At a celebration, suffragist Carrie Chapman Catt spoke about the victory. “Women have suffered agony of soul which you never can comprehend, that you and your daughters might inherit political freedom,” she said. “Prize it!”

481,481,Honoring an Artist,"{'History', 'Arts'}","
Ruth Asawa was an American artist. She became famous for her abstract sculptures. She usually made them from wire. Their forms were inspired by nature.
Asawa’s life and work are now being honored on a postage stamp. On August 13, the United States Postal Service will release a set of 20 stamps featuring Asawa and her work.
Ethel Kessler designed the stamp set. She focused on 10 of Asawa’s sculptures. Kessler told TIME for Kids, “The more range I can show of an artist’s work, the more fascinating it becomes.”  
Asawa’s Story 
Asawa was born in Norwalk, California, in 1926, to Japanese immigrants. As a child, she was often busy with school and chores. But she found time to do what she loved: making art. 
Asawa’s life changed suddenly in 1941. That year, Japan bombed Pearl Harbor, a U.S. naval base in Hawaii. The U.S. declared war on Japan. The following year, President Franklin D. Roosevelt ordered that people of Japanese ancestry be sent to internment camps. This was to isolate them from the rest of the nation. 
Life in an internment camp was difficult. But Asawa met Japanese-American animators there. They had worked for Walt Disney Studios. They helped Asawa with her drawing skills. 
Asawa was released from the camp in 1943. She later pursued her education at Black Mountain College, in North Carolina. She also traveled to Mexico, where she learned basketmaking. She used the technique to loop wires together into sculptures. Then she hung the sculptures from the ceiling. Her designs were influenced by shapes she observed in nature, such as spiderwebs and snail shells. 
Art for All 
Asawa is celebrated for her public art, too. Her fountains can be found in Northern California. Among San Francisco residents, she became known as the Fountain Lady. 
Asawa supported arts education. She urged politicians to fund arts programs. In 1982, she helped start a public arts high school in San Francisco. In tribute to her, it was named the Ruth Asawa San Francisco School of the Arts. 
Kessler says she was drawn to Asawa’s legacy as well as her work. “Her lifelong passion for art, and especially her commitment to working closely with kids and communities, continues to inspire me.”

Joe Biden is the Democratic presidential nominee. On August 11, he selected United States senator Kamala Harris to be his vice-presidential running mate. They will take on President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence in the 2020 presidential election. The nomination makes Harris the first Black woman to appear on a major party’s presidential ticket. She is also the first person of Asian descent to be on a presidential ticket. 
Biden tweeted about his VP pick on Wednesday. “Kamala Harris grew up believing in the promise of America,” he wrote. “Together, Kamala and I are going to fight every single day in the White House to make sure that promise is fulfilled for all Americans.”  
Harris posted on Twitter that she was “honored” to be the Democratic party’s nominee for vice president. She wrote that she will “do what it takes” to make Biden the next president of the United States. 
Harris is the daughter of immigrants. Her mother was born in India. Her father is Jamaican. Harris grew up in Oakland and Berkeley, California. She attended Howard University, in Washington, D.C.
Harris first entered public office in 2004. She was the district attorney in San Francisco, California. Later, she served as the state’s attorney general. Harris was the first Black woman to hold either position.
In 2016, Harris was elected to represent California in the U.S. Senate.
Like Biden, Harris made a run to become the Democratic Party’s presidential nominee. She took part in several debates before the primaries. That’s when people vote to select the party’s candidate. Harris dropped out of the race before voting began.
Now, Harris’s appearance as the first woman of color on a major party’s national ticket is inspiring others. “It tells Black girls that they can be president,” China Cochran said. Cochran recently ran to be a state representative in Michigan. 
Melanie Campbell is the president of the National Coalition on Black Civic Participation. She says Harris’s nomination sends a message. “It affirms Black women and all we did for this country,” she says. “I’m glad I lived to see it.”
Harris is scheduled to debate Vice President Mike Pence in Salt Lake City, Utah, in October.

It was the first splashdown landing by American astronauts in 45 years. It was also the first time a commercial spacecraft was used to carry people to and from orbit. 
The astronauts were arriving from the International Space Station.  They had spent two months there. 
“Welcome back to Planet Earth and thanks for flying SpaceX,” said mission control from SpaceX headquarters.
The capsule had entered the Earth’s atmosphere at 17,500 miles per hour. That caused the air around the capsule to heat up. Temperatures reached 3,500°F. The capsule slowed as it descended. It landed about 40 miles off the coast of Florida, traveling 15 miles per hour. 
The capsule was lifted onto a recovery ship. The astronauts were examined by doctors and nurses who had been quarantined for two weeks and had been tested for the coronavirus. This was for the astronauts’ protection. After checkups, Hurley and Behnken were flown to a base in Houston. 
Elon Musk is the owner of SpaceX. He welcomed the astronauts at a small masked gathering of family and officials. “I’m not very religious, but I prayed for this one,” he said to the group. 
Historic Landing
SpaceX is the first private company to launch people into orbit. And this was the first launch of NASA astronauts from U.S. soil in nearly a decade. Until this mission, NASA relied on Russian rockets to take astronauts to space.
The mission has set the stage for another SpaceX launch next year. Eventually, the company could fly tourists into space. Gwynne Shotwell is SpaceX’s president. She hopes this mission will lead to “doing even harder things,” like astronaut flights to the moon and Mars.
NASA is on board with the plan. Administrator Jim Bridenstine said from Houston, “We are entering a new era of human spaceflight.”

487,487,Education Update,"{'People', 'World'}","
“The COVID-19 pandemic has led to the largest disruption of education ever,” said António Guterres on Tuesday. Guterres is secretary-general of the United Nations (U.N.). In a video message to the world, he spoke of schools closed in more than 160 countries in July. This is “affecting over 1 billion students,” he said.
The loss of education could lead to increased inequality around the world, he added.
Guterres didn’t make this video address just to share statistics. He announced a new campaign. It’s called Save Our Future. It will be run by U.N. agencies. Educational partners will help too.
Guterres also issued a policy brief, or plan. It proposes how education should continue, both during and after the pandemic. “We are at a defining moment for the world’s children and young people,” he said. “The decisions that governments and partners take now will have lasting impact on hundreds of millions of young people . . . for decades to come.”
Call to Action
The policy brief focuses on four key areas of education. First is reopening schools. Once COVID-19 is under control in an area, getting kids back to school “as safely as possible must be a top priority,” Guterres wrote on the U.N. website.
Second, world leaders must invest more money in education. “Education budgets need to be protected and increased,” Guterres says. 
Third, it’s important to protect the most vulnerable students. These include students in poorer countries. They may have had trouble accessing education even before the pandemic. We “must seek to reach those at greatest risk of being left behind,” Guterres says.
Finally, the policy brief calls for the world to reimagine education. This includes investing in digital technology and finding new ways to support teachers. 
Guterres writes, “We must take bold steps now, to create . . . education systems fit for the future.”

Robotics is a complicated field. But brothers Sanjay and Arvind Seshan, of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, found an early passion for it. In 2014, they embarked on a mission to make it easier for others to learn robotics by creating the website EV3Lessons.com. There, they teach people to code through a series of online tutorials.
“We were looking at resources for learning how to program Lego Mindstorms, and we realized that there wasn’t really anything good out there,” Sanjay told TIME for Kids Kid Reporter Eshaan Mani. “We wanted to create a concise set of lessons from which kids and adults can learn easily to program the Lego Mindstorms EV3 robot.” 

The website started off with basic lessons on robotics and coding. But now the lessons can support kids who have been involved with robotics for years and who want to learn something new. “I think that one of the reasons why it’s been so successful and that kids like it is because they’re being taught by other kids,” Sanjay says.
The brothers understand that robotics takes patience and lots of time. They recall a project called Pix3l Plott3r, a robot that would print people’s pictures, as well as different designs and logos. It took them two years to get a fully working model, and they made six or more versions. The Seshan brothers’ advice is to never give up if something does not work the first time and to try different ways of solving the problem you’re facing.

492,492,Tribal Lands Returned,"{'Places', 'United States'}","
The Esselen Tribe is a group of indigenous people in Monterey County, California. On July 27, the Esselen regained land that belonged to their ancestors. It is the first time they have gotten back any of their former territory, which they lost some 200 years ago.
“It is beyond words for us, the highest honor,” Tom Little Bear Nason told the Mercury News. He is the chairman of the Esselen Tribe of Monterey County. “The land is the most important thing to us. It is our homeland, the creation story of our lives. We are so elated and grateful.”
The tribe worked with the Western Rivers Conservancy to buy the land for about $4 million. The money came from a California state proposition passed in 2018. Citizens voted for grants to be set aside for Native American natural, cultural, and historic resources in the state.
The land is in an area of Northern California known as Big Sur. The Esselen lived there for more than 8,000 years. But the land was taken by the Spanish in the 1700s. Most of the Esselen people died. Today, the tribe has just 214 members.
Tribal leaders plan to bring back their cultural ceremonies and teach people about Esselen history. “Getting this land back gives privacy to do our ceremonies,” Nason says. 
Seeing Progress
There have been other landmark wins for Native American tribes recently. In early July, a court ordered the shutdown of the Dakota Access Pipeline, in North Dakota. It carries oil through land that is sacred to the Standing Rock Sioux. The same month, corporate sponsors pressured the Washington Redskins football team to change its name. Many consider the name offensive.
In South Dakota, there have been protests near Mount Rushmore. The monument features the carved faces of presidents George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, and Theodore Roosevelt. People are calling on the U.S. government to return the area to the Great Sioux Nation. 
The Esselen say they will not build businesses or permanent homes on their land. They plan to share it with other tribes from the area.

493,493,Landmark Law,"{'Government', 'History'}","
In 1952, Judy Heumann went to register for kindergarten. But the principal stepped in. He told Heumann’s mom that her daughter was not allowed to attend the school.
That was because Heumann had a disability. As a child, she had polio, a disease that can affect the spinal cord. It left her with limited use of her arms and hands, and with paralyzed legs. She used a wheelchair to get around. 
Heumann went on to get an education. She became a teacher and an activist. But because of her disability, she had to fight for access at every turn.
“It’s totally different today,” she says. 
That’s thanks in large part to the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). This civil-rights legislation was signed into law 30 years ago this month, on July 26, 1990. It was designed to protect people with disabilities against discrimination. It helps make sure that they can participate fully in different activities.
Under the ADA, schools and workplaces are now required to have ramps, elevators, designated parking spots, and curb cuts. (Curb cuts are small ramps built into a curb or sidewalk.) These places must also accommodate people with a range of disabilities, including people who are blind or deaf. 
The Making of the ADA 
The ADA was decades in the making. In the years before it passed, activists worked hard. They held many demonstrations. One was a 28-day sit-in. It took place at a federal government building in 1977. Heumann helped organize the event.
 As lawmakers debated the measures, activists stuck together. Their unity ensured that the ADA would eventually protect people with all kinds of disabilities.
The results today are powerful: Many public buses have lifts for wheelchairs. Disabled children attend school alongside their nondisabled peers. Employers are generally aware that people with disabilities have civil rights that cannot be violated.
As President George H.W. Bush said in 1990, at the law’s signing ceremony, “It will guarantee fair and just access to the fruits of American life, which we all must be able to enjoy.”
The ADA was an important step. But activists say there is still more work to do so that people with disabilities are treated fairly. A new generation of activists is pushing the disability rights movement in new directions. For example, they want to address racial justice issues.
“It leaves us with this next call to action,” says activist Keri Gray. “How can we continue to uplift this piece of legislation, and how can we think about what else needs to come after it?”

When Oprah Winfrey was a kid, she moved around a lot. Her childhood was chaotic. But while she was still in high school, she got a job reading the news for a local radio station. She went on to become one of the world’s most famous talk show hosts.
Winfrey’s story has been an inspiration for many people. And it’s included in the latest season of Good Night Stories for Rebel Girls: The Podcast. In the podcast, notable women read from the popular book series of the same name. They read the stories of extraordinary women in a fairy tale format. This season includes episodes about entertainer Josephine Baker, gymnast Simone Biles, and others. 
Winfrey’s story is read by her best friend, Gayle King. King is a broadcast journalist who has known Winfrey for many years. “I marvel at her accomplishments,” she told TIME for Kids. “She doesn’t have a family legacy to help her. She did this. She’s been breaking barriers and ceilings since she was 19.”

497,497,Polar Bears in Danger,"{'Environment', 'Animals'}","
Most polar bears could disappear by the end of the century, scientists say. Global warming is to blame.
According to a study published this month in Nature Climate Change, most polar bear populations will be in serious decline by 2080. The cause is melting sea ice. Polar bears hunt seals on the ice. Without ice, the bears must roam on the shore, where they are spending more and more time away from their main food source. That means the animals could starve.
“There’s not enough food on land to sustain a polar bear population,” Péter K. Molnár told the New York Times. He is the study’s lead author.
Lack of food leads to another problem: Mother bears may not be fat enough to produce milk for their cubs. Some bear populations could stop having babies, leading to a rapid decline in numbers.
Polar bears are the largest land carnivores on the planet. They help keep other animal populations in check. Losing them would throw habitats off-balance. “Their loss would reverberate throughout the ecosystem,” Marika Holland says. She’s one of the authors of the study.
Arctic sea ice usually melts in the spring and summer, then grows in the winter. But now, the ice is taking longer to grow back. Weather statistics say the Arctic is warming twice as fast as the rest of the planet. Ice in the region has declined 13% every 10 years since the 1970s. 
The Arctic is home to roughly 25,000 polar bears. Scientists have long known that the animals are in danger. This study, which looked at 13 of the world’s 19 polar bear populations, is the first to identify when they could disappear. 
But the study also notes that it is still possible to slow Arctic melting. The world can reduce the burning of fossil fuels and lower the greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change. It would have to be a drastic reduction. Bringing emissions to only a moderate level will still mean the loss of some polar bears.
Saving the bears is up to us, Holland says. “I believe that there is hope,” she says. “But humans need to act quickly to turn that hope into a reality.”

Representative John Lewis, longtime congressman for Georgia, died on Friday after a battle with pancreatic cancer. He was 80 years old. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi confirmed Lewis’s death in a statement on Monday. “Today, America mourns the loss of one of the greatest heroes of American history,” she said.
Lewis devoted his life to fighting for equality for all Americans. He served in the United States Congress for more than 30 years, and he was one of the last living leaders of the civil rights movement. He marched beside Martin Luther King Jr. in the 1960s, and he used what he learned to promote activism among generations of young people.
Civil Rights Leader
Lewis was born in Troy, Alabama, in 1940. At the time, the South was segregated. Laws were in place that made Black people second-class citizens. “I had grown up in rural Alabama very, very poor,” he wrote in TIME. “I saw signs that said ‘White’ and ‘Colored’ . . . And I would ask my mother, my father, my grandparents, ‘Why? Why is that?’ And they’d say, ‘That’s the way it is.’”
Lewis could not accept that answer. At 18, he heard King speak on the radio. It spurred him to action. He took part in sit-ins at segregated lunch counters in Tennessee. In 1961, he joined the first Freedom Riders. These demonstrators, Black and white, traveled by bus through the South to challenge segregation at bus terminals. 
Lewis was one of the organizers of the March on Washington, in 1963. That’s where King made his “I Have a Dream” speech. Lewis also spoke at the event. “How long can we be patient?” he asked the hundreds of thousands who’d gathered in the nation’s capital. “We want our freedom, and we want it now.”
A few years later, Lewis led another of the most famous marches in American history. In March 1965, he and 600 people walked from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama, to push for voting rights for Black people. At Selma’s Edmund Pettus Bridge, they were met by police, who ordered them to turn back. The protesters refused, and were beaten by police. Television coverage of the violence outraged the nation and drew support for the Voting Rights Act. On August 6, President Lyndon Johnson signed it into law.
On to Congress
In 1986, Lewis started his career as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives. He became known as “the conscience of Congress,” earning respect from leaders in both parties. In 2016, a shooting in Orlando, Florida, left 49 dead. Lewis led memebers of Congress in a 25-hour sit-in to force the House to vote on gun control.
This June, George Floyd was killed by police in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Lewis viewed the protests that followed as a continuation of his work. Speaking to CBS This Morning, he said, “It was very moving, very moving to see hundreds of thousands of people from all over America and around the world take to the streets—to speak up, to speak out, to get into what I call ‘good trouble.’ . . . There will be no turning back.”

A fun way to put yourself in a good mood is by creating a mood board, sometimes called a vision board. What’s that? “It’s a collage of anything that inspires you, makes you happy, or speaks to you,” says Susie Moore, an author and life coach. Moore often guides people through the process at mood-board-making sessions. At the end of a session, each person has built a collection that puts him or her in a positive frame of mind.
To create your own mood board, you’ll need a corkboard and pushpins. Poster board or cardboard, with glue or tape, work too. You’ll also need old magazines, greeting cards, and photographs. Go through them, cutting out images for your board. Use your instincts to choose what works best. “Anything that makes you feel good, use it,” Moore says. “When you see it, you’ll know.”
Here, TFK’s Shay Maunz uses Moore’s tips to create a mood board and offers tips on how you can make your own. 
One place to start is with some of your favorite things. I used photos of my favorite food, watermelon, and my favorite animal, penguins.You might use your mood board to set goals for things you’d like to accomplish. I want to read at least 30 books this year.Think about a place that makes you feel safe and happy. Maybe it’s your classroom, a playground, or a cozy corner at home. You can put photos of that place on your mood board, or choose photos that remind you of it. I used this image of West Virginia, where I grew up.This is also a good time to think about what might make you happy in the future. I included a photo of the beach, because I hope to go there soon.Not everything on your mood board has to serve a purpose or be connected to your life. Choose some images just because you like them.

When you envision a forest, you probably imagine a vast stretch of land covered with trees. But as traditional forests are destroyed, tiny forests have sprung up in cities around the world. They’re increasing biodiversity and fighting climate change. 
Mini forests are inspired by Akira Miyawaki, a plant scientist from Japan who pioneered a way of growing them. It’s known as the Miyawaki method. This involves planting a variety of native trees close together.  
The Miyawaki method is said to grow trees 10 times faster than other methods. And these tiny forests are more biodiverse than traditional forests. That’s according to a 2018 study by Wageningen University, in the Netherlands. The study says the diversity of tree species attracts a greater variety of insects and amphibians.
Growing Movement 
The Miyawaki method has become popular in Europe. Boomforest is an organization in Paris, France. In November, it planted two forests using the Japanese botanist’s technique. In the Netherlands, IVN Nature Education helped communities build 100 forests using the Miyawaki method. It plans to double that number by 2022. 
Simon Lewis is excited about tiny forests. He’s a professor of global change science at University College London, in England. Lewis explains that trees absorb carbon dioxide, or CO2. That’s a gas that contributes to climate change. 
But not all methods of growing trees help the planet. Lewis points to trees grown and cut down to make paper. “When that paper is thrown away, it rots,” he told TIME for Kids. “Carbon is released back in the atmosphere.” And then the trees aren’t there to soak it up.
Lewis hopes more people will plant mini forests. While talking with TFK, he said, “This interview has inspired me to try to get one going where I live!”

Chelsea Phaire is trying to cheer up the world, one art kit at a time. The 10-year-old is the founder of Chelsea’s Charity. Its mission is to deliver art supplies to kids in all 5o states. Chelsea also wants to deliver art kits to kids in other countries. As of July 7, Chelsea’s Charity had given away nearly 3,000 kits.
Chelsea lives in Danbury, Connecticut. She was 8 when she thought of the charity. “My mother and I had a conversation [about the fact] that not everyone had access to art,” Chelsea told TIME for Kids. “And that made me so sad.” But it took her parents some time to get on board with the idea. They wanted her to wait until she was a little older.

Chelsea was able to launch her charity last year. For her 10th birthday, she asked friends to donate art supplies instead of giving her presents. Chelsea has also saved money from birthdays and from helping at her dad’s barbershop to buy art supplies for her charity. The art kits she puts together go to kids in homeless shelters and hospitals, and to kids who’ve been affected by school shootings.
The charity has suffered financially because of the pandemic. Chelsea says, “Instead of personally giving [art kits] out, we had to mail them,” which was expensive. But increased attention on her efforts has helped donations boom.
The Power of Art
Chelsea says art has helped her through difficult times: “I use art to express myself and make me feel better when tough things happen.” This is why she feels it’s so important that everyone should have access to art.
Art is also a great way to release emotions, Chelsea says. “If everyone knows how to channel their negative emotions and thoughts into art, then we can prevent the next big disaster and we could solve world peace,” she adds. “You never know unless you try.”

COVID-19 infections continue to rise in the United States. At press time, almost 3 million cases have been confirmed in the U.S. According to Johns Hopkins University, 50,000 new daily cases were confirmed across the country on July 1, and 41 out of 50 states are seeing a rise in such cases. This is a record high.
Sunbelt states were hit hardest. These include Florida, Texas, and California. They reopened earlier or faster than other states. Over the July 4 holiday weekend, Florida set a record, with 11,400 new cases in one day. California and Texas saw a rise in hospitalizations related to COVID-19.
Health officials worry that July 4 celebrations are leading to even more infections. “We set a record for highs over the holiday weekend,” said Alabama health officer Scott Harris. “Given the number of people who were out and about over the weekend celebrating, we are certainly concerned about what the next couple of weeks are going to look like as well.”
Elected leaders are updating health rules and warning citizens to remain alert. Carlos A. Gimenez is the mayor of Miami-Dade County, in Florida. On Monday, he made plans to suspend indoor dining at restaurants. Beaches in Miami were closed over the weekend, although Gimenez reopened them today. “But if we see crowding and people not following the public health rules, I will be forced to close the beaches again,” he said.
Jim Justice is the governor of West Virginia. He has ordered nearly all people in his state to wear masks at indoor public spaces. “I’m telling you, West Virginia, if we don’t do that and do this now, we’re going to be in a world of hurt,” he warned. “It’s not much of an inconvenience.”

The best ways to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus are to practice good hygiene and social distancing, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Wash hands often, with soap and water for 20 seconds. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.
Wearing a mask that covers your mouth and nose can also help prevent the spread of disease. So can avoiding large crowds and keeping your distance from others.

The Cleveland, Ohio, Major League Baseball team has been known as the Cleveland Indians since 1915. But that might change soon. On July 3, the organization announced it’s considering new names.
“We are committed to engaging our community . . . to determine the best path forward with regard to our team name,” the club said in a statement.
Some people are offended by the team’s name. It’s part of a long-running debate about Native American names and images used by sports teams. This wouldn’t be the first time the Cleveland Indians have made a change. The Indians’ former mascot, Chief Wahoo, was removed from the logo in 2019.
Terry Francona is the team’s manager. On Sunday, he spoke to reporters on a Zoom call. “I think it’s time to move forward,” he said. Later, he added, “I’m glad that we’re going to be open to listening, because I think that’s probably the most important thing right now.”
A Growing Movement
The Cleveland Indians aren’t the only sports team considering a change. The Washington Redskins are the National Football League team in Washington, D.C. Their name and logo have been criticized for decades. The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines redskin as an offensive term for American Indians.
On July 4, Redskins coach Ron Rivera told the Washington Post that the team is working on a name and logo change. “If we get it done in time for the season, it would be awesome,” he said.
Rivera’s announcement came after several sponsors, including Nike, spoke up. They urged the team to change its name or they would end their sponsorships. Nike says it will stop selling merchandise related to the Redskins until the team’s name is changed.
Francona, of the Cleveland Indians, calls racial sensitivity a “very difficult subject.” But he says it is important to address. “Even at my age,” the 61-year-old says, “you don’t want to be too old to learn or to realize that, ‘Maybe I’ve been ignorant of some things’ . . . and to try to be better.”

A new live musical is coming to Disney+. It’s Hamilton, the Broadway show that premiered in 2015. The show is about Alexander Hamilton, the first treasury secretary of the United States. It begins with Hamilton’s arrival in New York from Nevis, a small island in the Caribbean. It follows him through the Revolutionary War and his political rise. The musical uses rap, hip-hop, and R&B to tell the story of America’s first years as a country.
Chris Jackson (pictured, left) plays George Washington, America’s first president. “When we think about our Founding Fathers, we think about those antique portraits and the old guys on our currency,” Jackson told TIME for Kids. But the actors who play the Founding Fathers in Hamilton are people of color. Jackson says Hamilton was intended to breathe life into these historical figures while telling “the story of yesterday, by Americans now.”
The producers of Hamilton had planned to release this live recording of the show next year. But after the coronavirus pandemic hit, they decided to release it on July 3, just ahead of Independence Day, so people can watch while stuck at home. Jackson hopes it will help kids of color see themselves in the story of America. “To know they’re just as capable of moving the ball, of furthering the idea of what America is supposed to be,” he says. “It didn’t include us back then, but we’re a fulfillment of what that dream is.”

Writers are often asked, “Where do you get your ideas?” Many say ideas spring from paying close attention to what’s around us. Depending on the kind of writing you do, the spark of inspiration can lead to very different results. 
Let’s use this photo as an example. A journalist will focus on facts. What’s happening here? Musicians in Barcelona, Spain, are playing for an audience of plants. The event was live-streamed on June 22. It was the first concert at the opera house since Spain’s coronavirus shutdown began. The artist who came up with the idea for the concert said that during the quarantine, he found inspiration in nature. The 2,292 plants were later donated to health-care workers. 
What a wild story! Now imagine you’re a fiction writer. Can you make the story stranger? Let your creativity blossom! Some of the best stories are based on real-life events.

When I was 9 years old, I received my first handmade card. It was from a classmate. He was from South Korea. He had a hard time adjusting to his new school in New Jersey. So I helped him. He surprised me later by giving me a card to show his appreciation. It was a folded piece of paper from his spiral notebook. He drew a picture of us on the front. There were only a few sentences inside because he didn’t know how to write in English. Those words meant a lot to me. 
From then on, I knew handwritten cards were special. They take time and effort to make, and they feel very personal. Cards can also be saved and looked back on. You can make your own unique card with supplies you have at home. Or you can buy a card from a store. What’s most important is the message you write inside.  
A Personal Touch
The first step is to think of a person for whom you want to make a card. Will you give it to a friend or a family member? Or is it for someone who might need encouragement?
Then think about what kind of card you’d like to make. There are congratulations cards, thank-you cards, holiday cards, and more.Now it’s time to write. For me, this is the hardest but most rewarding part. A big tip while you’re working on a card is to keep in mind the person you’re making it for. You can ask yourself some questions. 
For instance, what do you appreciate about him or her? Your words can be as sweet or as funny as you want. If they’re personal, the message will be special.
Last, sign your name and put a date at the bottom. This will be helpful in case the recipient keeps the card to reread sometime in the future.
It’s hard to put your feelings into words. But getting a handwritten card or letter can make someone who needs it feel appreciated.

A marker, a magazine or newspaper, and a little imagination. That’s all it takes to create blackout, or redacted, poetry. But the effort can yield surprising results. Naomi Shihab Nye is the Poetry Foundation’s Young People’s Poet Laureate. TIME for Kids editor Brian S. McGrath asked her to create a blackout poem using one of our recent articles. Here, Nye shares her poem and offers tips for making your own.

To Make a Blackout Poem
First you have to read an article or a few paragraphs or a page, then close your eyes and think.
What words stand out to you from what you just read?
Do any other parallel or related images come to mind besides what was written about in the piece?
In the fascinating article in TIME for Kids about sinkholes in Rome, Italy, I kept thinking about the deepest silence, solitude, and quiet we all felt during the shelter-in-place period. We were all staying at home, going nowhere except in our minds. It was as if every city and town and street and block were surrounded by quiet. Embedded in quiet. In the mornings, you could not hear any traffic. Only birds. Or . . .
I went back to the magazine page and made a copy of it.
Then I wrote my poem on another page, just plucking words or phrases in order from the piece. 
Then I went back to the copied page and blacked out all the other words.
That’s the recipe! Blackout poem!
Then I gave it my own title. 
I’m sure there are other ways to do it, too.

514,514,How to Write Funny,"{'Culture', 'Arts'}","
What sorts of things do you find funny? Think about the last thing that really made you laugh. Humor is all around, if you look at life through a comedic lens. You might read, hear, or notice something that you think is hilarious or share a ha-ha moment with a friend. 
Much of what’s funny happens in the moment. But you can sit down and write comedy, too. Stand-up comedians write and perform jokes in front of an audience. Screenwriters work humor into television and movie scripts.
You don’t have to be a professional to write jokes. There are tips and tricks you can use to come up with jokes of your own. TIME for Kids spoke with Theresa Julian, author of The Joke Machine, about writing to make people laugh. “When a joke lands and someone cracks a smile, there’s just so much satisfaction,” she told TFK. Here are a few of her pointers, along with examples. Study these, then try writing a few jokes of your own. 
SURPRISE your audience. All jokes are based on surprise. Humor is about leading a thought one way then adding a quick twist at the end that surprises us and makes us laugh.
My basketball team is good at dunking. Until we run out of cookies.
I was shopping for a new toilet but couldn’t decide if I wanted to buy it. I figured I needed to sleep on it.

EXAGGERATE to the point of ridiculousness. Stretch something to call attention to one of its main features.
Thirty days have September, April, June, and November. All the rest have 31 except January, which has 6,952.
Studying is 10% reading and 90% complaining to your friends that you have to study
COMPARE things that don’t belong together. Show how two totally different things have something in common. When we see the similarity, we’re surprised—and we laugh!
This Black Forest cake is awful. It tastes like there are chunks of actual forest in it.
I was really scared on the roller coaster, and trust me, I don’t scare easily. I’ve eaten the beans in the school cafeteria.
GET FACTS WRONG in an obvious way. Twist a simple well-known fact into something different to create a new, off-center thought.
I was surprised when my doctor told me I’m color-blind. That really came out of the orange.
Why are you worried I won’t get my homework done? I’ll spend an hour on the essay, an hour on history, and two hours on math. I’ll be done in five minutes.
CREATE PUNS by playing with words’ double meanings, similar sounds, spellings, or contrasts.

If you want to become a better writer, the most important thing to do is practice writing. Getting started is the hardest part. But we’ve got some tips. 
Author Lamar Giles says that as a young writer, he worried about people stealing his ideas. But then he realized something: “An idea is not a story. It’s a compass that works differently for every single person,” he says. “It might lead you to a poem, or to a short story, or to a novel. So you shouldn’t worry about someone running away with an idea you have, because they will never run in the same direction as you.” 
To get your creative juices flowing, TFK’s Shay Maunz asked some of our favorite authors to provide writing prompts for our readers. Choose a prompt below. This is where your writing will begin. Where it goes from there is up to you. 

While you are sleeping, a mysterious door appears in your room. When you bring your best friend over to check it out, he or she can’t see it. You pull open the door to try to show it to your friend, and you are both transported to a whole different world. Write what happens next.—Jasmine Warga, author of  Other Words for Home
You ask your parents for a pet, but they say no. While sulking in the woods behind your house, you stumble upon a huge egg. When the egg hatches, a baby T. rex toddles out. What do you do?  —Remy Lai, author of Pie in the Sky and Fly on the Wall 
“My name is [character name here] and I need you to listen very carefully. This is a matter of life and death . . .” —Lamar Giles, author of The Last Last-Day-of-Summer
Write about what it would be like to have a superpower that’s not so super. For example, you can fly, but very slowly and only two feet off the floor. Or you have the ability to turn invisible—but only for two seconds at a time. What would your life be like? What would your friends think of your not-so-superpower? —Jeff Kinney, author of the Diary of a Wimpy Kid series
Pick a prompt on this page, and try one or more of the following:Draw a story in panels, like a comic book or a graphic novel, without using any words.Write the story all in dialogue.Start your story with a scene that has at least two people in it. Write a few paragraphs. Stop, then start over again, writing the same scene but changing the people into animals or other nonhuman characters. —Linda Sue Park, author of Prairie Lotus and A Long Walk to Water

What first comes to mind when you think of a writer? Maybe it’s your favorite author or someone who works for a newspaper or magazine. But writers work on all sorts of things. They help create the games we play and the songs we listen to. Here, four writers in different fields talk about their jobs.  
Writing a World

There are lots of visual elements in a video game. But the story pulls everything together. That’s where a video-game writer comes in. 
James Pugh writes the story and dialogue for Lego video games. He’s worked on Lego the Incredibles and Lego’s new game Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga. “I am such a huge Star Wars fan,” Pugh told TIME for Kids in an email. “Being able to live in that world for the last two years has been amazing.”
According to Pugh, there are big differences between writing the story for a video game and writing a movie or book. “Structure and pace are even more vital when writing for a video game,” he says. While they work, writers have to consider the playable parts of the game. “It’s very much a collaborative process,” he adds. —By Karena Phan
On the Screen 

When Taneka Stotts was a kid, she loved cartoons. But she didn’t think that writing them was an actual job. 
Now Stotts is a screenwriter. That’s someone who writes scripts for movies and television. Stotts has worked on the cartoons Steven Universe Future and Craig of the Creek. 
As a screenwriter, Stotts works closely with other writers to imagine each episode. Because they’re focused on cartoons, the writers team up with storyboard artists, who sketch out whatever the writers dream up. One of the best parts of the job? “I love hearing voice actors speak the lines I have written,” Stotts told TFK. “They are saying what I wrote, no matter how ridiculous or silly.” —By Constance Gibbs
Food and Culture

Andrea Nguyen moved to the United States from Vietnam was she was 6 years old. “I was a refugee kid,” she told TFK. “I struggled so much with English writing.” 
Nguyen loved food, so she practiced English by reading cookbooks at the library. One book in particular made a big impact. It was by Irene Kuo. “She wrote in this vivid manner about food,” Nguyen says. “She was born in China and came here as a young woman. I really aspired to be like her.”
Now Nguyen lives in California and works as a food and recipe writer. She’s the author of several cookbooks. She also runs a popular Vietnamese cooking website called Viet World Kitchen. 
“Food writing serves as a window for people to understand different cultures and different experiences,” Nguyen says. “It means so much to me.” —By Allison Singer
Say it in Song

When Grace VanderWaal was 12, she performed on Season 11 of NBC’s competition show America’s Got Talent. She impressed audiences with a song she had written called “I Don’t Know My Name.” Soon after, Grace went on to win the season. 
Now 16, Grace has written many more songs and performed her music around the world. “Moonlight” is a song she cowrote with a producer. In it, Grace describes a time when a friend was going through challenges.
Reflecting on her feelings is what helps Grace write lyrics. “I’m constantly inspired by experiencing life and the realness of the emotions that come with that,” she told TFK in an email. Grace admits that while it can be tough to dive into her feelings, it leads to her “most honest and vulnerable songs.” —By Rebecca Mordechai

Updated June 29, 2020
Writer and journalist Larry Smith asks an interesting question: “Can you describe your life story in six words?” He leads a project called Six-Word Memoirs. A memoir is a story about the writer’s experiences. The project allows people of all ages to share their story. 
Smith launched the project in 2006, through his online publication, Smith Magazine. At first, visitors to the site simply shared their personal short stories. Then Smith had the idea to limit those stories to six words. The format gave users strict guidelines. “Submissions and enthusiasm exploded,” he told TIME for Kids. “Blank pages and websites are scary. But when you have the constraint of six words, it fuels creativity.” Six-Word Memoirs has since become a best-selling book series. 
Eventually, teachers began using Six-Word Memoirs prompts in the classroom, asking students to describe their summer vacation or summarize a book in six words. But now, because of the coronavirus pandemic, kids are facing new challenges. So Smith is offering a new writing prompt: Describe your life at this moment in six words. 
Sarah Nguyen, a teacher in Pasadena, California, took up the challenge with her sixth-graders. “Here was a way to showcase the experiences of our daily lives in this unique quarantine environment,” she says. One of her students wrote, “Screens are taking over my life.” Another wrote, “Not sick of my room yet.”
Smith recently did a workshop with students over Zoom. Twenty-four kids shared their six words with him. “It gave me such a good feeling,” he says. “This thing, which started as a literary riff in 2006, has become something that’s helping kids share and process the most intense time in their life.”

Try It Yourself!
TFK and Smith have a challenge for you. We want you to use just six words to describe what this time of social distancing has meant to you. If you’re unsure where to begin, Smith says to just start writing. “It’s hard to write the first one. It even took me a minute!” Being specific helps. “Remember, it’s a story of your life. Make it about you.” Here, Smith gives more advice:
Be honest. Write like you talk. Choose your words wisely. Rip it up if you don’t like it. See your reflection in another person. Ask a friend or family member to help. He or she will have a different perspective.
Try it at home. If you need examples, below are more Six-Word Memoirs sent by TFK readers.

Fourteen-year-old Paul Kimball has been cooking since elementary school. “Food is always better when you make it yourself,” he told TIME for Kids. “And I like being able to share food with friends and family members, and see their faces light up when they eat it.” 
Paul is one of the five authors of Chef Junior, a new cookbook made by kids for kids. It includes 100 recipes for kid-friendly foods. Paul believes the book is perfect for this period of social distancing. “You have all this time to get your cooking skills down,” he says. “Then you can put them into play and start making food for yourself and for other people.”  
Paul shared a recipe from the book with TFK: blueberry-banana ice pops. He likes this recipe because there are whole blueberries hidden at the bottom of each pop. “It’s like finding treasure,” he says.

Measuring Cup and Spoons
4 ice-pop molds or an ice-cube tray
Ingredients
1 cup milk
1 banana (can be frozen)
1 1/2 cup frozen blueberries

It’s a new album he wrote with his three daughters: Tigerlily, Tinkerbell, and Matilda. The album is a collection of songs they created together while sheltering at home due to the coronavirus pandemic.
To create the album, Tashian used his songwriting skills to set his daughters’ ideas to music. Tashian wrote the music and decided what kind of story he wanted to tell with each song. The girls used their imagination to come up with the lyrics. There are songs about being a pirate, creating your dream house, and visiting Paris, among other things. “I would ask them to fill in the blanks,” Tashian told TIME for Kids. “Like what they would put in the house, or what they think pirates would say, or what they would do in Paris.”

A team of biologists recently studied rainfrogs in the forests of northern Ecuador. While doing so, they made a surprising discovery: a Mindo harlequin toad. The creature hadn’t been seen alive in 30 years. The scientists couldn’t believe their eyes. 
“The three of us spotted it simultaneously,” Melissa Costales told TIME for Kids. She’s a conservation biologist. Her partners were scientist César Barrio-Amorós and reptile and amphibian guide Eric Osterman. 
“It took our brains a while longer than normal to recognize that we were watching an Atelopus mindoensis!” Their findings were published in the spring, in the journal Herpetology Notes. Herpetology is the study of reptiles and amphibians.
The Mindo harlequin is the latest harlequin toad species “to come back from the dead,” says Costales. Since 2003, eight others have been found, three of them in Ecuador.
Toads, Rediscovered
Until recently, 13 of the 25 species of harlequin toads in Ecuador had gone unseen since the 1980s or early 1990s. Scientists thought most of them had been wiped out by a fungal disease called chytrid. This illness is especially harmful to the harlequin toad.
Costales says the Mindo harlequin may have developed a resistance to the disease. That would explain the toad’s reappearance. And it could spell good news for other harlequins. Since discovering the first one, Costales’s team has found five more. They were all tested for chytrid. None had the disease. But that doesn’t mean the survival of the species is guaranteed, Costales says. The harlequin toad is still endangered.
Costales is developing a conservation plan with a zoology museum in Ecuador. She wants to make sure the Mindo harlequin toad doesn’t fall back into extinction.
“Each rediscovery gives us a second chance to develop better conservation strategies,” she says. “Not every day do we have the opportunity to rediscover a species that we believed to be extinct.”

523,523,Baseball Returns,"{'United States', 'Sports'}","
Back in March, the Major League Baseball (MLB) season was put on hold because of the COVID-19 pandemic. This week, the league announced its comeback.
The season is set to begin in late July and run until September 27. It will be shorter than usual. Each team will play 60 games over 66 or 67 days, instead of 162 games over 186 days. And they will be played in empty stadiums.
Some rule changes are also likely. Extra innings could start with a runner on second base. This will give the team at bat a chance to score right away, ending the game faster. And all teams might use a designated hitter. These players specialize in hitting. They take the pitcher’s place in the batting order. 
MLB hasn’t seen a season this short since 1878. Back then, the pitcher’s mound and catcher’s mitt hadn’t yet been invented. The current season could also be cut even shorter, if health conditions become unsafe for players at any time.
But a shorter season means each game counts more than usual. Any team could get on a hot streak, which would make a big difference in a brief season. John Smoltz is a Hall of Fame pitcher and a broadcaster. “There’s a lot more pressure . . . in a 60-game schedule,” he says. The teams aren’t facing the long haul of 162 games, he adds. They can go all out. 
Mike Stanton is also a former pitcher. He played in six World Series, winning three with the New York Yankees. “The teams that lose, they’ll be the ones going, ‘Well, it’s not for real, they didn’t play 162 [games],’” he told the New York Times. “But for the team that wins, it’ll be just as special as any other—and in some ways even more so, because of the trials and tribulations that everybody has gone through to get to that point.”
So far, 12 MLB players and staffers have tested positive for COVID-19. Players can sit the season out and still get paid if they’re at high risk for the disease. Anyone else who opts out will not be paid. 
Players are set to begin training on July 1. If nothing else, it will be a season for the history books. “This will be a year that everyone remembers,” Stanton told the Times. “Everyone.”

524,524,Pandemic Report,"{'World', 'Health'}","
The worldwide coronavirus pandemic continues to grow. On June 21, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported more than 183,000 cases, the largest increase in new COVID-19 infections ever counted in a single day. The total global number of cases to date has now passed 9 million. The surge comes as many societies try to repair their economy by reopening businesses and other public places.
“The epidemic is now peaking or moving toward a peak in a number of large countries,” Michael Ryan says. He’s the WHO’s emergencies chief. 
Brazil saw the sharpest rise in new cases on Sunday, with about 55,000. The United States was second, with more than 36,000. More than 15,000 were reported in India.
The U.S. remains the world’s leader in total infections, with well over 2 million. The northeastern part of the country, which was hit hard early in the pandemic, has seen its numbers fall. But the virus is now spreading across the South and West. Health officials say Florida could become the new epicenter of the disease. Early this week, the state passed 100,000 cases. In Texas and Arizona, hospitalizations for the virus are at their highest levels since the pandemic began. 
Parts of Africa are becoming hot spots. South Africa is averaging thousands of new cases a day. In Asia, China and South Korea watched infections fall after strict lockdowns. But now, as businesses reopen, new outbreaks are occurring.
Call for Leadership
Governments must do more to protect people, health experts say. Contact tracing—tracking down everyone who had contact with an infected person—needs to improve. And reopening public places should happen more slowly. 
“The greatest threat we face now is not the virus itself,” Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus says. He’s the WHO’s director-general. “It’s the lack of global solidarity and global leadership.”
For now, health experts advise people to continue taking protective measures. Wash hands frequently. Follow social-distancing guidelines. And wear a mask in public.

525,525,Malala Graduates,"{'People', 'World'}","
When Malala Yousafzai was 11 years old, she spoke out against the Taliban, an extremist group that does not believe in a girl’s right to education. Last week, at 22 years old, she graduated from Oxford University, in England.
Yousafzai posted photos of her celebration on Twitter. One shows her with her family. The other was taken after her “trashing.” Trashing is an Oxford tradition during which students are covered in confetti, food, and foam right after completing their final exams. 
“Hard to express my joy and gratitude right now as I completed my Philosophy, Politics and Economics degree at Oxford,” she wrote. “I don’t know what’s ahead. For now, it will be Netflix, reading and sleep.”

Congratulatory messages poured in from around the world. One was from NASA astronaut Anne McClain. “Congratulations on your graduation,” McClain tweeted. “For so many, higher education is the start of great things. For you, great things preceded it and I can only imagine the even greater ones to follow.”
Who is Malala?
Malala Yousafzai was born in Pakistan on July 12, 1997. When she was young, Taliban fighters took over her hometown. They said girls should not be allowed to go to school. Yousafzai was outspoken in her belief that girls have the right to an education. The Taliban tried to silence her. 
In 2012, armed men shot Yousafzai on her way home from school. She was flown to England for medical treatment. She healed, and she stayed in England to continue her education. 
Yousafzai was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014, when she was 17. This makes her the youngest Nobel winner in history. TIME for Kids readers also voted for Yousafzai as the top newsmaker of 2014.
Yousafzai started attending Oxford in 2017. She joined the cricket club, a debating society called the Oxford Union, and the Oxford Pakistan Society.
She has written books for both children and adults. She also raises money through the Malala Fund. This is a nonprofit group that fights for girls’ education.

Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts is a fantasy television show about a girl named Kipo. When the show began, Kipo was living underground, where it was safe for humans. In Season 1, Kipo travels to the surface in search of her missing father. There, she meets mutated creatures called “mutes.” The mutes look cute, but they’re actually dangerous animals. Eventually, Kipo finds her father—but he’s under mind control. That’s where Season 2 begins. The new season premiered June 12 on Netflix.
Karen Fukuhara plays Kipo. She says that in Season 2, we watch Kipo work through her problems with “poise and bravery.” Fukuhara feels the show is perfect for the present time, when there’s so much unrest in the world. “I think Kipo’s story is about not being fearful of failure but hoping for the best,” she told TIME for Kids.
A highlight of the new season is its soundtrack. “The music is really exciting,” Fukuhara says. “There’s a huge karaoke number. It’s really ear-catching music.”

527,527,Celebrating Juneteenth,"{'Holidays', 'History'}","
On June 16, Virginia governor Ralph Northam made an announcement. The state would move to recognize June 19, or Juneteenth, as a paid state holiday. The next day, New York governor Andrew Cuomo tweeted that he’d do the same in his state. This makes Virginia and New York the latest states to officially honor Juneteenth.
“Every year as a nation, we mark the Fourth of July Independence Day,” Northam said during a press conference. “But that freedom we celebrate did not include everyone.” 
Juneteenth commemorates the day in 1865 on which 250,000 people in Texas found out they had been freed from slavery. Learning more about the holiday means going back in history to the Civil War.
A Look at History
In 1860 and 1861, several Southern states separated from the United States. This started the American Civil War. The Southern Confederacy wanted to maintain slavery, while the Northern Union wanted to abolish it. 
On January 1, 1863, President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation. His speech declared freedom for enslaved people in the Confederacy. 
The Civil War ended more than two years later, in April 1865. The Union won. But there were many enslaved people in the South who had not been told of President Lincoln’s proclamation. On June 19, Union soldiers told crowds in Galveston, Texas, that the state’s 250,000 enslaved people were free. They were among the last to find out. 
The day became known as Juneteenth, a contraction of June and 19th. It is sometimes called Emancipation Day, or Freedom Day. Over the years, as Black people from Galveston moved to different cities, the celebration spread. And in the 1960s, the civil rights movement brought a wider awareness of Juneteenth. Two months after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., in 1968, Solidarity Day was held on June 19 in Washington, D.C. More than 50,000 people attended. 
Making a Holiday
Juneteenth has been celebrated in a variety of ways. Usually, there are community gatherings, cookouts, and festivals. There are parades and pageants. 
Texas became the first state to make Juneteenth a state holiday, in 1980. Now, at least 45 out of 50 states, plus Washington, D.C., recognize Juneteenth.

Sheila Jackson Lee represents Texas in the U.S. House of Representatives. Earlier this week, she introduced a bill to Congress. It asks for national recognition of the holiday. “One thing about national holidays, they help educate people about what the story is,” she told TIME. “Juneteenth legislation is a call for freedom, but it also reinforces the history of African Americans.”

528,528,Bike Boom,"{'Business', 'Transportation'}","
It was March when much of the world began to lock down to stop the spread of the coronavirus. The pandemic forced gyms to close. It made people fearful of public transit. And it left families cooped up at home while practicing social distancing. 
Now, because of the pandemic, many people have turned to bicycles for transportation, exercise, and entertainment. In the United States and around the world, bicycle sales have boomed. 
By April, bike sales in the U.S. were double what they were in April 2019. In the past two months, U.S. bicycle sales have seen their biggest spike since the 1970s. That’s according to Jay Townley. He studies bicycle industry trends. 
“People quite frankly have panicked, and they’re buying bikes like toilet paper,” Townley says. He’s referring to the rush to buy essential goods when the pandemic began. 
Now the U.S. is experiencing a bicycle shortage. That’s partly because of high demand. It’s also because most bikes sold in the U.S. are made in China. Factories there closed when China went into lockdown in January. They have since reopened. But they’re only beginning to catch up to the demand. 
Taco Carlier is the cofounder of VanMoof, a Dutch e-bike maker that sells bikes around the world. He says the company has seen “unlimited demand” since the pandemic began. This has led to a 10-week backlog for some bikes. Usually, the company’s bikes are delivered in one day. 
The bike craze isn’t limited to the U.S. Cities like Manila, Philippines, and Rome, Italy, have installed new bike lanes. These have helped people get around during the pandemic. The Italian government offered citizens a rebate for 60% of the cost of a new bike.
Joe Minutolo is a co-owner of Bar Harbor Bicycle Shop, in Maine. Minutolo hopes people continue to ride bikes long after the pandemic has ended. “People are having a chance to rethink things,” he says. “Maybe we’ll all learn something out of this, and something really good will happen.”

What are your thoughts, feelings, and opinions about the global coronavirus emergency? We asked our readers to let us know at tfkeditors@time.com, with the permission of a parent, teacher, or guardian. Here, we'll share some responses.
Updated June 18
From Seoul, South Korea:
COVID-19 made me stay at home. But I like staying at home. My parents come back home early and we get to spend more time together. I still wish COVID-19 to end. —Kevin Sangjin S., age 11
The virus stopped me from playing outside. I can’t go outside and eat. When it is over, we can go to restaurants and eat. I wish to dine out with my parents again! —Jimmy Dongwoo K., age 11
The biggest challenge is that I have to study online. I wish to study and play with my friends at school in person. I wish we could go back to our normal lives. —Tom Kyuhyeun L., age 9
I miss school. I’m bored at home. I don’t have things to play with. I used to like playing with a computer, but I have realized that playing with friends outside is more fun. —Daisy Yaewoon P., age 10

From Shanaya P., age 11, in Memphis, Tennessee:
The COVID-19 pandemic has changed lives forever. We have been at home, but I salute all healthcare workers who have risked their lives every single day to help us stay healthy and safe. Here, I describe my experience during this time.  
The last few months have been a roller coaster ride. Coming back home from my spring break vacation, I got news that school is closed for two weeks. Being a kid, I got excited, but I didn’t know what was in store for us. Here we are now, months later, still stuck at home. I never thought I would be doing my classes virtually. Who knew this would happen? 
Right after the “stay at home” orders, my mom tested positive for COVID-19 and our family was quarantined for 14 days. It was really challenging for all of us, especially for my mom, who got sick, and my dad, who is an infectious disease physician. Those were the worst two weeks in my life. 
Watching my mother suffer with fever, cough, and shortness of breath was heartbreaking. I had tears in my eyes, but I didn’t tell my parents about it. I was thankful that my dad is a doctor who knows how to treat COVID-19 patients. After three weeks, my mom got better, and she came out of her isolation room. It was then that I took a sigh of relief.
My dad is a true hero. He was taking care of us, and although he was in quarantine, he was seeing patients every day via tele-med (video-call appointments) and saving lives one at a time. My dad has been treating patients with COVID-19 every single day and serving the community selflessly. I am proud of him.
This experience has taught me to be grateful for things we have in life. My dad has taught me to be selfless, helpful, and courageous. Here is my advice: It is OK to be anxious, but remember that there is light at the end of the tunnel and life will get normal again. This is the time to do creative projects and explore hidden talents and connect with family and friends. Eventually we will all learn from this experience and live with a “new normal.”
From Riddhy R., age 9, in, Toronto, Ontario, Canada:
My whole life has changed due to the coronavirus. It’s very upsetting because we can’t meet anyone else and we can’t go to others’ homes. My family makes it look like another normal day to me, but around the world l know it is a different story. People are getting affected every minute. l’m really thankful to doctors and store owners for helping us during this.
My family and I actually had a lot of fun during this time. We got to stay up late and wake up late because we don’t have to get ready for school, only homeschool. We even can stay in our PJs for the whole day since no one will see us. l play board games with my family, which ends up like a tournament because we’re always trying to beat each other. It is really fun! But sometimes it gets out of control.
My family is worried about my relatives. What if they get sick? What if they run out of food? But my mom says that soon the pandemic will be over. l really hope it goes away, like really soon. l really do not like staying home all day because l feel trapped. 
From Luke P., age 10, in Bulverde, Texas:
My experience during the COVID-19 pandemic has not been perfect but boy has it been fun. I miss my friends and my teammates, but I’m trying to make the best of it. I have been able to play a whole lot more on my bike. I have also played a ton of baseball. When my mom is at the store, I have to watch my brothers to make sure they don’t do anything stupid. My brother Brooks is easy because he is 7, but my youngest brother is a whole other story.   
Watching a toddler is not easy. Sometimes my mom is gone for an hour and my dad is working. When she gets back, the house is a big mess. I have to keep him entertained without breaking something or getting in trouble. Also, all my brother wants to do is watch a movie but I make him play outside. As you can see, watching a toddler like my brother is very hard, and that’s just one of the things I have been doing to help my mom and dad.
I get a lot of “me time” on my bike rides. I ride to the park, go on the bike trail, then I leave the park and go on the other bike trail. Brooks just got a new bike, so now he is riding with me. I do it every morning from 7 to 8. It is a lot of work but it pays off because it makes me feel strong.
Lastly, I am in my batting cage a lot more than normal. I play a point game: it is first to 100 points and it is so much fun. I do baseball every day to get better and sometimes my dad comes and helps me. It is truly a great place to go when you need to waste energy or you are bored. It is truly the best sport ever and I miss my team. All in all, staying home during the pandemic has been different but it sure is fun. 
From Jaxson S., age 7, in Mableton, Georgia:
I’m not afraid of the coronavirus, but I am worried that it will get more people sick than the flu. Me and my mom are not able to go out very much. I went to Florida. Me and my mom stayed for 30 days. I was so excited to spend so much time with my family. I really miss school. I have two masks to wear when I go out. I am worried COVID-19 will last for a long time but I hope the best for everybody. ¡Le agradezco su ayuda, gracias por su servicio!

From Sophia S., age 8, in Lecheria, Anzoátegui, Venezuela:
I am a little sad because I can’t see my friends and can’t go out, but we have to think positive. We have to believe in us and have faith, hope, and strength. In quarantine time, I do my homework, study online, play with my little brother, talk with my friends by video call, and spend a lot of time with my parents. I hope we can find the coronavirus vaccine ASAP. We have to learn the new way to live.

530,530,Fires in Arizona,"{'United States', 'Weather'}","
A wildfire burning northeast of Phoenix, Arizona, is now the largest active fire in the United States. That’s according to the National Interagency Fire Center. So far, the fire has consumed more than 89,000 acres, or about 140 square miles. 
The Bush Fire broke out on Saturday. By Tuesday, it had doubled in size. At least 1,600 people living east and north of it have evacuated their homes.
Officials say the fire began after a burning car pulled off a highway and set the roadside grass ablaze. “The fire is burning very heavy,” Tiffany Davila told the Arizona Republic. She is a public affairs officer at the Arizona Department of Forestry and Fire Management.
More than 400 firefighters are battling the Bush Fire. At press time, they had not yet gained control of it. Their job is made more difficult by high winds, dry grass, and hot temperatures. “That makes for some rapid fire growth—extreme fire behavior,” Dee Hines told the New York Times on Tuesday. Hines is a spokesperson for the team that is managing the fire.
Firefighters are also battling smaller blazes in other parts of the state. The Bighorn Fire is raging north of Tucson. It has consumed nearly 16,000 acres. As of Wednesday morning, it was 40% contained. Meanwhile, the Mangum Fire is burning north of the Grand Canyon. It has consumed almost 48,000 acres. On Wednesday, it was 3% contained. 
Only a few injuries or damaged structures have been reported from any of the fires. 
Two Battles to Fight 
The fires come at a difficult time for Arizona. The state has recently seen a sharp increase in coronavirus infections. Yesterday, around 2,300 new cases of COVID-19 were reported. 
This is a challenge for residents who have evacuated their homes. Officials have told people to “avoid close contact with those who are sick.” Experts are also urging people to “practice public health recommendations when relocating.” This includes wearing a mask and maintaining social-distancing measures.

531,531,Hummingbird Hues,"{'Science', 'Animals'}","
Caleb Arnold loves birds—especially hummingbirds. The 7-year-old from Slidell, Louisiana, knows a lot about his favorite fliers. “They pollinate stuff, and they’re pretty and small,” he says. But there’s one thing Caleb didn’t know: Hummingbirds see a wider range of colors than we do.
It makes sense that Caleb didn’t know this. Few people did for sure, until June 15. That’s when researchers published a report in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. It confirmed what scientists have long suspected. “Birds can see a whole range of colors we humans can only imagine,” Mary Caswell Stoddard says. “They are experiencing a color world that is beyond our own.”
Behind the Science
Stoddard is an assistant professor at Princeton University, in New Jersey. She and a team of scientists conducted a three-year experiment to find out if hummingbirds are able to distinguish between colors that look identical to humans.
To understand the experiment, it’s important to know how color vision works. There are three types of tiny color-sensitive cones in the human eye. Birds, and some other animals, have a fourth. This means they can also see ultraviolet (UV) colors. “The UV cone type allows birds to see combination colors that humans can’t, like UV green and UV red,” Stoddard says. “Biologists studying birds have assumed for a long time that birds can see these, but it’s been challenging to test this idea.”
That’s exactly what Stoddard’s team did. They put two bird feeders in the wild at the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory, in Colorado. One contained plain water. The other contained sugar water. Both feeders held a specially designed LED light stick—“sort of a bird-vision light tube,” Stoddard says—that changed colors.
“If I showed you the UV green tube and the green tube, they’d both just look green to you,” Stoddard says. But the hummingbirds saw the difference. They could even distinguish between two shades of UV red. The scientists observed that the birds were able to use the color of the lights to find the sweet water.
Caleb’s glad scientists want to better understand birds. “Good!” he said, after hearing the news. “They’re part of nature.”

532,532,Matching a Million,"{'Culture', 'World'}","
Korean pop group BTS have donated $1 million to the Black Lives Matter organization. The donation, which was announced on June 6, came after the death of George Floyd. Floyd, an unarmed Black man, was killed by a police officer in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on May 25. Since then, people around the world have taken part in protests against racism and the treatment of Black people by law enforcement.
Before the donation was made public, BTS spoke out on Twitter. “We stand against racial discrimination,” they said. “We condemn violence. You, I and we all have the right to be respected. We will stand together.” 
Kailee Scales is the managing director of Black Lives Matter. She spoke to Variety about the donation. “Black people all over the world are in pain at this moment,” Scales said. “We are moved by the generosity of BTS and allies all over the world who stand in solidarity in the fight for Black lives.”
Fans Step Up
BTS have supported many good causes, including a campaign against violence with UNICEF, the United Nations Children’s Fund. And often their fans unite behind the band’s charity work. The $1 million Black Lives Matter donation was no exception.
After the donation was reported, BTS fan group One in an ARMY began a #MatchAMillion campaign on Twitter. Its goal is to match the BTS donation with another million dollars. In one day, the campaign raised $1,026,531. The money is for groups that support protesters and initiatives for Black people. 
A fan who goes by the name Daezy helped launch the #MatchAMillion fan campaign. She spoke about it with Affinity Magazine. “This was more than just some statement,” Daezy said. “This was a flicker of hope. And I hope that others will be inspired to help fight for Black lives as we have.”
Having helped start the campaign “means the world to me,” she added. “I’m so glad I could help.”

Hero Elementary isn’t a typical school. It’s where teacher Mr. Sparks helps superheroes learn to master their powers. The students include a tiny girl with super strength, a brainiac who builds incredible gadgets, an animal lover who can create force fields, and a girl who can fly but is afraid of heights. There’s also the class hamster, Fur Blur, who can move super fast.
Hero Elementary, a new series on PBS, follows these young heroes as they work together to solve problems and help their community. Often, they find they can’t rely on their superpowers for a solution. When that happens, they turn to science.
Carol-Lynn Parente is a cocreator of the show. She hopes Hero Elementary shows kids that they can use science in their everyday lives. “Science is active,” Parente told TIME for Kids. “It’s all about getting out there in the world and doing science.”
What superpower would Parente like to have? She’d like to be able to skip the coronavirus pandemic. “Right now, I would really love the power to fast-forward time,” she says. “So I could get to a place where hugs are in big supply and we’re through the worst of what’s going on in the world.”

534,534,Back to the Movies,"{'Places', 'World'}","
As countries ease coronavirus restrictions, businesses and other public places are slowly reopening. Movie theaters could be next.
AMC, the world’s largest cinema operator, announced on Tuesday that it plans to reopen “almost all” of its theaters in the United States and Great Britain in July. And it’s not the only one. More than 90% of movie theaters worldwide will have opened by the middle of next month. That’s according to the National Association of Theatre Owners. The organization represents cinema owners in 98 countries.
The coronavirus pandemic has been tough on these owners. Theaters have suffered huge financial losses during the shutdown. AMC says it has lost more than $2 billion in recent months.
But money is not the only reason to reopen theaters, Adam Aron says. He is AMC’s chief executive officer and president. “Billions of people have endured confinement” during the pandemic, he says. “There will be a significant pent-up demand to get back out in the world.”
Still, many people might not feel safe reentering public places. On Monday, the World Health Organization (WHO) warned that the pandemic could be getting worse. There were more than 136,000 new COVID-19 cases on June 7. That’s the highest number of infections reported in a single day since the pandemic began. So far, more than 7 million people worldwide have gotten the disease. “This is not the time for any country to take its foot off the pedal” or to relax, warned Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. He is the WHO’s director-general. “The pandemic is far from over.”
Theater executives say measures will be in place to protect visitors. Theaters will sanitize seats before each movie showing. Groups will be seated at least six feet apart, and guests will be able to order snacks by phone. Cinema employees will be required to wear masks. Some theaters in the U.S. will limit audience size to 25% of what it normally would be.
Aron believes that these measures will make moviegoers feel safe. “We are confident we are taking the necessary steps,” he says.

535,535,Biden Secures Nomination,"{'Government', 'Election 2020'}","
Who will be running against President Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election?
On June 2, several states and the District of Columbia held presidential primaries. Three days later, the results were in: Joe Biden had won each of those contests. These victories, plus his wins in previous primaries, will make him the Democratic Party’s nominee for president of the United States. He will run against President Trump in November.
Biden served as vice president for President Barack Obama from 2009 to 2017. Before that, he represented Delaware in the U.S. Senate for 36 years. This is Biden’s third run for the presidency. It’s the first time he has secured the nomination.
More than two dozen Democrats—which might be a record-setting number—tried to become the party’s 2020 nominee. When U.S. senator Bernie Sanders ended his presidential campaign in early April, Biden was the last Democratic candidate still in the running.
On Friday night, Biden released a statement. “It was an honor to compete alongside one of the most talented groups of candidates the Democratic Party has ever fielded,” he said. “I am going to spend every day between now and [the election] fighting to earn the votes of Americans all across this great country.”
For now, Biden’s fight will largely take place online. That’s because of the coronavirus pandemic. Most large gatherings are banned in the U.S. This means in-person campaign events will be difficult. In April, Biden hosted a virtual town hall from his basement. “I’m used to being in a television studio, or out standing before a couple thousand people talking,” he said. But, he added, “I’m trying to learn.”
Each of the two major political parties will hold a national convention in August. At the Democratic convention, which will probably take place online, Biden will officially be named the nominee. The city for the Republican convention has not yet been confirmed. It was originally planned to be held in Charlotte, North Carolina. At press time, it seemed likely some or all of it would move to Jacksonville, Florida. There, President Trump would officially be nominated for a second term in office.

536,536,Treasure Hunt,"{'United States', 'People'}","
For years, thousands have traveled to the Rocky Mountains in search of hidden treasure. Adventurers were on the hunt for a bronze chest. It was said to be filled with diamonds, rubies, emeralds, and gold. On June 6, news broke that the chest was finally found. The person who found it has chosen to remain unidentified.
Forrest Fenn is an antiques collector. He lives in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Fenn created the treasure hunt more than 10 years ago. He hoped it would inspire people to have fun and explore nature.
Fenn received a picture confirming that the chest had been found. “It was under a canopy of stars in the lush, forested vegetation of the Rocky Mountains and had not moved from the spot where I hid it,” he announced on his website.
Fenn published an autobiography in 2010. It’s called The Thrill of the Chase. In the book, he dropped hints about where the treasure chest was located. The clues were in a form of a 24-verse poem. Readers had to use the poem to solve the puzzle.
“Begin it where warm waters halt,” reads one verse, “and take it in the canyon down.” This led many explorers down dangerous roads in search of the chest’s location. A few people even died in the attempt.
What’s Inside?
The jewel-filled chest is estimated to be worth more than $1 million. In 2017, Fenn told a local newspaper that the chest weighs 20 pounds and the contents weigh 22 pounds. It took him two trips to bring everything to the hiding spot.
For a decade, Fenn added new items to the chest. Animal figures, prehistoric “mirrors” of hammered gold, and ancient jade carvings are some of the unique treasures that were in the mix of jewels.  
Fenn says the end of the hunt is bittersweet. “I feel halfway kind of glad, halfway kind of sad because the chase is over,” he says. “I congratulate the thousands of people who participated in the search and hope they will continue to be drawn by the promise of other discoveries.”

537,537,Protests Continue,"{'United States', 'People'}","
People around the world are continuing to attend mass protests. They are speaking out against racism and the treatment of black people by law enforcement. Demonstrations started on May 26, the day after a police officer in Minneapolis, Minnesota, killed an unarmed man named George Floyd during an arrest. They have increased in size and number since. (Click here to read our earlier story, “Protesters Call for Justice.”) 
Possibly the largest rally this weekend was in Washington, D.C. Tens of thousands gathered peacefully on the National Mall and on the steps of the U.S. Capitol. Hundreds of thousands more took to the streets in about 150 U.S. cities. Protests also took place in France, Germany, Australia, and other countries. Although some of the early protests turned violent, those in recent days have been largely peaceful.
Roderick Sweeney took part in a rally in San Francisco, California. He says having white protesters speak out alongside black protesters sends a powerful message. “Nothing is going to change until our white brothers and sisters voice their opinion,” Sweeney says.

The Road to Change
The protests have already shown some results. All four Minneapolis police officers involved in Floyd’s death have now been arrested. And on Sunday, the Minneapolis City Council, a group of lawmakers, said it supported disbanding the Minneapolis Police Department. That could mean shrinking the police force, or getting rid of it altogether and hiring new officers. The city has also agreed to ban police use of techniques that have hurt people they are restraining. Lisa Bender is the president of the Minneapolis City Council. She says it is “clear that our system of policing is not keeping our communities safe.”
The protests have motivated leaders in other cities to push for reform, or change. Braxton Winston is a member of the city council in Charlotte, North Carolina. He has proposed changes to the police department there. Government leaders could have pushed for these kinds of changes long ago, he told TIME. But the protests have made a huge impact on what city leaders are able to accomplish. He says “we may be in a moment where people that are in positions like mine are finally getting the political will” to act.

Eight states and Washington, D.C., held primary elections on June 2, amid nationwide protests and a coronavirus pandemic. In what could be a sign of the times, the winners in many of these races were women of color.
For primary elections, voters choose the candidates they want to represent their political party in November’s general election. Candidates could be running for president or for a seat in the United States Congress. Voters might also choose local leaders, such as mayors. 
More women are running for office in the 2020 elections than at any other time in history. A record 490 of them filed to run for seats in the U.S. House of Representatives this year. That’s according to Rutgers University’s Center for American Women and Politics. 
Despite the pandemic, primary voters cast ballots in huge numbers. Many chose to mail in their ballot. Others followed social-distancing guidelines as they waited in long lines to vote at polling stations.
Getting Results
When votes were counted on Tuesday, it became clear that it was a big night for women. Come fall, people in states such as New Mexico, Indiana, and Iowa, will be able to choose between two female candidates in multiple contests.
New Mexico will elect three women to the House in November. One of them could be Democrat Teresa Leger Fernandez. On Tuesday, she won her party’s nomination for the northern district of the state. “This is a win for our communities and families across our district,” she wrote on Twitter. If she wins in November, New Mexico will have the largest House delegation of women of color in history. 
Paulette Jordan is a Native-American former state representative of Idaho. She won a Democratic Senate primary in her state. In Ferguson, Missouri, Ella Jones became both the first woman and the first African-American mayor. “My election gives people hope,” she told the New York Times. “Everybody is looking for a change.”

A cyclone struck Mumbai, India, on Wednesday, the first to hit the city in more than a century.
Cyclone Nisarga swept into the coastal city from the Arabian sea. It brought heavy rain and wind of up to 68 miles per hour, lashing skyscrapers and tearing apart houses near the beach. Boats were tossed around on the choppy water. About 10,000 people were forced to evacuate. No deaths have been reported.
Mumbai is the capital of India’s Maharashtra state. The city is home to more than 18 million people. Since it rarely experiences such powerful storms, Mumbai did not have cyclone shelters ready. Many of its largest buildings had already been turned into treatment centers for patients with COVID-19.
“We moved people to other strong buildings where there is a supply of water,” Krishan Kumar said. He’s a spokesman for India’s National Disaster Response Force.
Maharashtra State has been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic. It has more than a third of India’s 200,000 cases. More than 100 patients were moved from tents into hospitals, to protect them from heavy wind. Officials ensure that social-distancing guidelines are being followed in all emergency shelters.
Scientists say powerful storms are becoming more common in the Arabian Sea. K.J. Ramesh is former chief of the India Meteorological Department. He says the sea’s temperature is rising because of climate change. This makes cyclones stronger and more frequent. Predicting them “becomes a challenge,” he says.
In recent days, Maharashtra’s COVID-19 infection rate has slowed. It’s now below the national average. 
Chief Minister Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray is Maharashtra’s top official. He says the state will withstand the cyclone even as it weathers the pandemic. “Let us fight this danger like we are standing up to the corona pandemic and are on our way to defeat it,” he says. “We will prevail over this situation too!”

542,542,A Mammoth Find,"{'Science', 'History'}","
Archaeologists have uncovered the bones of 60 mammoths near Mexico City, Mexico. The fossils were found under an airport that’s under construction. In October, Mexico’s National Institute of Anthropology and History began digging at the site. Since then, archaeologists have excavated the bones of 60 mammoths. Experts say there are many more in the ground.
“There are too many, there are hundreds,” says the institute’s Pedro Sánchez Nava. Archaeologists have been able to excavate about 10 mammoths a month since their work began. They will continue to dig until 2022, when construction at the airport is completed. So far, nothing has been found that would require work on the airport to stop.
Mammoths were huge, elephant-like herbivores. They disappeared from the region that is now Mexico some 10,000 years ago. They became extinct around 4,000 years ago. Scientists say the new fossils could help them understand why the species died out.

Some of the bones were found on the shores of an ancient body of water. The large, shallow lake is gone, but it was once surrounded by grass and reeds. This attracted mammoths, each of which ate up to 330 pounds of plants every day. “It was like paradise for them,” Sánchez Nava says.
The excavations are happening about six miles from San Antonio Xahuento, where mammoth fossils were found last year. Scientists discovered two pits there that were six feet deep. They were dug by humans, about 15,000 years ago.
Scientists believe hunters used the pits to trap mammoths. People may have chased the animals into these traps. The bones of 14 animals were found in of them.
At the new site, the mammoths probably died after getting stuck in mud. Sánchez Nava says it’s possible that humans chased the animals into the soft earth. After doing so, they may have eaten the mammoths. The large number of fossils indicates that prehistoric humans may have regularly eaten mammoths. “In fact, it may have been part of their daily diet,” Sánchez Nava says.

543,543,Hometown Heroes,"{'People', 'Community'}","
TIME for Kids has written about people taking heroic steps to help one another during the COVID-19 pandemic. We’ve also asked readers to tell us about whom they’d like to acknowledge during this time. Here, 10 young people illustrate and write about hometown heroes who have made a big impact on their lives. Check out the entries and let them inspire you to thank your hometown hero!
From Sonny P., 10, Shelby Township, Michigan:
My hometown hero is someone I always looked up to. He’s my older brother, Giuseppe. He’s a volunteer firefighter. His future wife, Kate, works as a certified nursing assistant at the hospital. Giuseppe volunteers his time there, too, and is going to school to be a police officer. He goes to visit our grandma to make sure she’s okay. He also made care packages for families that are dealing with COVID-19. He likes to make a difference and always wants to help. He’s willing to put his own life in danger to help others. He’s tough as nails and never asks for anything. I haven’t seen my brother much since the COVID-19 pandemic started. It’s hard to be away from him, but I know other people need him. My whole life, I have wanted to be just like my hero. I’m going to follow in his footsteps and help everyone I can. 
From Jordyn H., 11, Oroville, California: 

From Addie S., 12, Eau Claire, Wisconsin:

My mom does everything she can to help our family and other people. On April 14, she went to Hope Lutheran Church to give blood. My mom also got a sewing machine for Christmas, and put it to use making masks for hospital workers. She had never used her sewing machine before. So she had to learn how to use it first, and then she made masks. It took her about five days to make them all. And she donated money to the Humane Society. Think about all of the dogs and cats and bunnies. My mom gave money to help them.
From Robert J., 8, Atlanta, Georgia:

I want to thank all of the doctors and nurses that are helping people who have the virus.
From Veronica C., 8, Fair Lawn, New Jersey: 

From Vincent R., 10, Shelby Township, Michigan:

My hometown heroes are my parents. They both deliver mail for the United States Postal Service (USPS). My dad, Paul, works in our town. My mom, Ricki, works in another town. They’re my heroes because they deliver mail and packages. Some of the packages contain medicine, essential items, and things people can’t get at stores. My parents also have conversations with people on their routes. One day, my mom helped an elderly man who fell in his house. Both of my parents walk several miles a day and see hundreds of people. Both of them took an oath to deliver mail through snow, rain, and even a pandemic. The USPS logo is an eagle. It represents hope, strength, resilience, and courage. 
From Grace K., 9, Conneaut, Ohio:

From Kylie M., 12, San Antonio, Texas:
I want the teachers, nurses, and everyone who is making a difference to know that I appreciate you deeply for what you are doing. If we help others and contribute our time, then we can get through this. Don't forget we are all in this together.
From Yeteva B., 10, Cincinnati, Ohio:

From Peyton M., 8, Baltimore, Maryland:
My hometown hero is my mother. She is my hero because she helps with my schoolwork. She explains my work to me better. My mother tries to keep me safe and my life normal during this pandemic.

544,544,Protesters Call for Justice,"{'United States', 'People'}","
Protesters have taken to the streets across the country and around the world. They are expressing their anger about the treatment of black people by law enforcement. On May 25, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, a man named George Floyd was killed by a police officer during an arrest. A bystander recorded the event and shared the video on social media. People were outraged by what they saw.
Floyd’s death is part of a history of black people being killed during encounters with police officers. “I’m so sick and tired of it,” says Mahira Louis, 15. She was at a protest in Boston, Massachusetts, on Sunday.

Demonstrations are taking place in dozens of cities. Many have been peaceful. People march, chant, carry signs, and call on leaders to make positive change. In some cities, however, demonstrations have seen violence. People have smashed store windows and stolen merchandise. Protesters have thrown rocks at police officers. Police have fired pepper spray and rubber bullets at protesters. Many people have been hurt. Governors in nearly half the states have requested soldiers from the National Guard to try to maintain order.
Melvin Carter is the mayor of St. Paul, Minnesota. He says the violence makes the protests less productive. “Those who are expressing that anger in a . . . destructive way are taking the focus away from what it should be,” he said on the TV news show Face the Nation on Sunday. “It must stop.”
James Talton, a protester in New York City, told TIME that some people become destructive because they feel it’s the only way to get people to listen to their concerns. “It seems like nobody’s paying attention,” he said.

A Growing Movement
The United States has a long history of protests against injustice. During the civil rights movement of the 1960s, protests were common as activists such as Martin Luther King Jr. led the fight against segregation. Protests also helped guarantee that black people could exercise their right to vote. But the civil rights movement did not make all things equal for black Americans. Racism is still a big problem in the U.S.
In 2012, a 17-year-old named Trayvon Martin was killed by a man in his neighborhood in Sanford, Florida. A year later, a jury found that man to be not guilty of a crime. After the trial, activists started using the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter on social media to express their outrage. It caught on, and what started as a hashtag grew into a movement.
Social media has helped bring widespread attention to instances of civilian and police violence against black people. Many people use the #BlackLivesMatter hashtag to call for justice and demand change. During the current protests, people have been carrying signs and wear shirts that say “Black Lives Matter.”
What Happens Next?
Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was arrested on May 29 and charged with Floyd’s murder. If found guilty, Chauvin faces up to 35 years in prison. Three other police officers were there when Floyd was killed. They were fired from the police force and are being investigated by state and federal law enforcement agencies. As of June 1, they have not yet been charged with a crime.
Meanwhile, the protests continue. Officials are working to control any violence that may occur. Many cities have put curfews in place to limit the number of people who are out at night, which is when tensions seem to rise.
“I don’t want the protests to be just for show,” Floyd’s cousin Tera Brown said. She spoke to CBS News. “We want to see [the officers] convicted for what they did. He did not deserve what happened to him.”

545,545,One Giant Leap,"{'United States', 'Space'}","
On May 31, astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley arrived at the International Space Station (ISS). Their trip there in Endeavour, the SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule, made history. American astronauts have not lifted off from the United States since 2011. Also, the capsule and rocket that took them into space was built and run by a private company: SpaceX. Never before has a private company taken American astronauts into space. 
NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine congratulated Behnken and Hurley on their accomplishment. “The whole world saw this mission, and we are so, so proud of everything you have done for our country and, in fact, to inspire the world,” he said on a call from Mission Control, in Houston, Texas. Hurley said it was a “real honor” to be part of it.
Taking Flight
The countdown to liftoff began on the afternoon of May 30. People around the world watched and waited in anticipation. The shuttle was originally scheduled for liftoff from Kennedy Space Center, in Florida, on May 27. But that launch was scrubbed, or called off, because of bad weather. By the weekend, conditions had improved. The launch was back on track.

The astronauts docked at the ISS about 19 hours after liftoff. When they arrived, they got a special message from Earth.“Welcome to the International Space Station,” the SpaceX control team said from its headquarters in Hawthorne, California. They were greeted by the three other astronauts already aboard the ISS.
Mission Achieved
Behnken and Hurley will spend one to four months in space. They’ll conduct experiments. They may also perform a spacewalk. Then they’ll return to Earth in the capsule that took them to the ISS. They’ll splash down in the Pacific Ocean.
Billionaire Elon Musk is the founder of SpaceX. He sees the mission as a milestone for the company as well as for the country. It gives him hope for the future of space travel. “This is hopefully the first step on a journey toward a civilization on Mars,” he says.

546,546,Good Night!,"{'Movies and Television', 'Time Off'}","
How long is your bedtime routine? For Elmo, it’s about 15 minutes. That’s the length of an episode of The Not-Too-Late Show with Elmo, a new talk show hosted by the popular Sesame Street character. In each episode, Elmo gets ready for bed—brushing his teeth, putting on his pajamas—while chatting with guests and entertaining his audience.
Executive producer Ben Lehmann says the team at Sesame Street thought a talk show would be a fun new project. “Having a talk show gives you the ability to do games, do challenges, tell jokes, and have musical guests on,” he told TIME for Kids. “It felt like the perfect show for Elmo.”
Elmo gets help running the show from his Sesame Street pals, including Cookie Monster and Rosita. And he’s joined by celebrity guests, such as Lil Nas X, Kacey Musgraves, and fellow talk-show host Jimmy Fallon. “Even Batman puts in an appearance later in the season,” Lehmann says.
Elmo is a 3½-year-old monster. But that doesn’t mean older kids and adults won’t enjoy the show. “It’s meant to be a family show,” Lehmann says. “We think the older kids will love the humor, the jokes, and the challenges, such as Would You Rather Say the Alphabet Backwards or Jump on One Leg While Eating a Slice of Lemon?” 
The show premiered this week on the new streaming service HBO Max. 

Want to learn more about this fun show? Hear from the star himself: Elmo! He responded to TFK’s questions by email.
Q: Why did you want to host a talk show before bedtime?
A: Elmo loves making people laugh and learning about his friends and putting on a show, so Elmo thought hosting his own talk show would be a lot of fun! We tell jokes and sing songs and play games with celebrity guests, all before Elmo’s bedtime. Elmo goes to bed at 7:30. That’s why it’s Not-Too-Late. 
Q: Who are some guests who will appear?
A: So many amazing people visited The Not-Too-Late Show: Lil Nas X and Ciara and Blake Lively and the Jonas Brothers! Nick and Kevin and Joe even helped Elmo’s daddy with the dishes after the show! Oh—and Batman!
Q: What is your favorite game to play?
A: Definitely the tricycle race! No, no. Freeze Dance. Or maybe Beach Ball Ballyhoo? We play too many fun games on the show. Elmo can’t pick just one!
Q: What’s your favorite part of the show? 
A: Elmo’s favorite thing about The Not-Too-Late Show is that Elmo gets to work with all of Elmo’s friends. Cookie Monster is Elmo’s cohost, and Rosita is the stage manager, and Abby Cadabby is the head writer. Elmo even has a house band: Mama Bear and the Monsters! Everybody helps out. Elmo also likes wearing his snazzy suit.
Q: Why will kids love The Not-Too-Late Show?
A: Elmo had a lot of fun making it, so Elmo hopes everybody will have fun watching it!
Q: What do you do when you miss playing with your friends?
A: We’re learning new ways to play together. When Elmo misses Cookie Monster or Abby or any of Elmo’s friends, we have a virtual playdate. Elmo just learned that word: vir-tu-al! Elmo’s mommy and daddy set up a camera so Elmo can see everybody and play games on video calls. Elmo’s favorites are Freeze Dance and Elmo Says. That’s like Simon Says—but with Elmo.

547,547,Waiting to Launch,"{'United States', 'Space'}","
It was to be the first rocket launch to put NASA astronauts into orbit from American soil in nearly a decade. But on May 27, with about 17 minutes left on the countdown clock, the launch was called off. Dark clouds hovered over Cape Canaveral, Florida. There was a possibility of lightning.
Veteran astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley were aboard the SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule. It sat atop the Falcon 9 rocket. The astronauts were on their way to the International Space Station (ISS).
The rocket was set to launch from the same pad used for the Apollo moon missions of the 1960s and 1970s. Earlier in the day, NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine spoke. He said that with this launch, “everybody can look up and say, ‘Look, the future is so much brighter than the present.’” He hoped it would be an “inspiration to the world.”
Astronauts have not taken off from the United States since 2011. That was the year the space shuttle was retired. Since then, NASA has depended on Russian spaceships to take astronauts to the ISS. They were launched from Kazakhstan, in Asia.
The new flight was also to be the first such launch by a private company, SpaceX. NASA hired the company in 2014. It’s run by billionaire Elon Musk. Eventually, SpaceX could sell spaceflights to other companies or countries. That could lead to new kinds of tourism and research.
SpaceX’s Crew Dragon capsule is bigger than those of the past. It can carry seven astronauts. It also includes touch-screen controls. The old Apollo ships used buttons and knobs. “We want it to be as safe and reliable as you’d expect from the most advanced spacecraft in the world,” Benji Reed says. He’s a mission director for SpaceX. But “we also want it to look amazing and beautiful,” he says.
Bridenstine later explained why the flight was called off. He said a liftoff could “actually trigger lightning.” This could happen because of electricity in the atmosphere. “If we are not ready to go, we simply do not go,” he said.
The launch has been rescheduled for May 30.

549,549,Social Snakes,"{'Science', 'Animals'}","
A long, scaly creature slithering alone through the grass—that’s how we usually picture a snake. But a new scientific study could change that image. Snakes can be long. And they’re certainly slithery. But they may not be the loners we thought they were.
Morgan Skinner and Noam Miller, the scientists who led the study, found that snakes actively search for other snakes to spend time with. Simply put, snakes have friends. 
“Like us, they seek out social contacts,” Skinner told National Geographic. 
Miller and Skinner did the study at Wilfrid Laurier University, in Canada. They published their findings last month, in the journal Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology. Their study joins a growing body of research showing that friendships among animals could be more common than we thought.
The scientists conducted an experiment using 40 eastern garter snakes. This species is often found in the southeastern United States. 
The snakes were tested for personality traits such as boldness and shyness. Scientists then put them into an enclosure, 10 at a time. The enclosure had four little house-like structures in it. For eight days, Miller and Skinner watched the snakes traveling from house to house. Occasionally, they removed a snake from the enclosure, then put it back in different a structure. The researchers noticed something interesting: No matter where they put the snakes, the creatures found a way to rejoin their “friends.” 
Snakes “have sophisticated social cognition,” or understanding, Miller says. “They can tell others apart.”
“And they’re choosy about whom they socialize with,” Skinner adds.
Why would snakes need friends? It could be for protection. And it “may have nothing to do with the reasons humans have friends,” Miller says. In other words, it’s unlikely they’re looking for buddies to play video games with. It’d be hard to hold the controller without hands, anyway.

Each year, TIME for Kids selects kid reporters from all around the United States. They report on current events, interview interesting people, and review the latest books for TIME for Kids and TIME Edge. This year’s group had a few extra challenges, but they pulled through like pros.
Now we’re looking for a new batch of young journalists to join our team! Visit timeforkids.com/2020-kid-reporter-contest to learn more.
“To any prospective reporters out there, please apply to be a TIME for Kids Kid Reporter,” says TFK Kid Reporter Eshaan, from Texas. “It’s an amazing experience, and I highly recommend it.” Here, Eshaan and three of his peers share their experiences over the past year.
Alexis Bumah, age 13
One challenge I had to overcome was my shyness. When I applied, I was really shy and wasn’t one to put myself out there a whole lot. But over the past few months, I’ve definitely come out of my shell more, and that’s formed me into the amazing junior journalist I am today.
Eshaan Mani, age 14

I’ve had such awesome experiences over the past year. For example, I cohosted the TIME for Kids Explains: Pandemics podcast. It was super-duper fun. I also had a viral moment last fall when the Democratic debate came to Houston, Texas.
Nora Wilson-Hartgrove, age 10

Being a Kid Reporter was a life-changing experience. It opens up opportunities that you could not get anywhere else. I was also lucky to get an amazing editor. She was always sending me emails with exciting and fun assignments. I even got to be in TIME magazine. 
Priscilla L. Ho, age 11

My favorite experience was when a group of other TIME for Kids reporters and I interviewed astronaut Andrew Morgan, who was part of a crew on the International Space Station. At first, I had trouble with interviews because it was hard talking to people I didn’t know. But interviews for TIME for Kids have let me grow out of this problem.

552,552,Parks Reopen,"{'Places', 'United States'}","
All around the country, states are loosening coronavirus restrictions. Businesses, restaurants, and other public places are slowly reopening. On Memorial Day weekend, people crowded onto beaches for the first time in months. But many weren’t following social-distancing guidelines.
This could become a problem at national parks, which are also starting to reopen. The Grand Canyon, in Arizona, began admitting visitors again in mid-May. At the time, at least one tourist felt safe. Matthias Zutter, a visitor from Switzerland, told the Associated Press: “You could see that people took precautions and were keeping their distance.” But that could change as the summer heats up. And it presents a challenge for park officials.
Cam Sholly is the superintendent of Yellowstone National Park. Most of it is in Wyoming. The park gets 4 million visitors a year. Sholly says it’s hard enough for staff to keep people away from wildlife, such as bears and bison. “The notion that we’re going to keep every human being six feet apart is ridiculous,” he says. He adds that a “massive amount of signage” has been posted around the park. It encourages visitors to keep a safe distance apart and to clean their hands.
Some parks will close off sections to prevent crowding. Grand Canyon visitor centers, hotels, and restaurants remain shut down. But its cliff-hugging trails will be open. Spokesperson Lily Daniels says hikers will be expected to practice “self-governance.”
That’s a bad idea, says Rob Arnberger, a former superintendent at the park. “It simply defies logic,” he says. In his opinion, people are likely to cluster at popular spots.
Other parks, such as Rocky Mountain National Park, in Colorado, may use timed entry to manage crowds. Visitors will have to buy tickets in advance.
For now, parks are working with health officials to make sure visitors are safe. Sholly says it’s a time of uncertainty: “No one’s an expert at reopening national parks in a pandemic.”

Many nursing homes all over the world are locked down to protect their residents from COVID-19. But a company in Belgium has found a way to connect these people with their loved ones outside.
Usually, Group-f is a cleaning and maintenance company. Its employees wash the outsides of tall buildings, using platforms that are lifted by cranes. A crane is a large machine that can lift and move things. 
When the coronavirus pandemic hit Belgium, Group-f’s business slowed down. The cranes sat unused. But one day, company manager Tristan Van den Bosch saw something unusual: a man standing on the ground, shouting up to his mother. She was looking down at him from her window on the third floor of a nursing home. 
This gave Van den Bosch an idea: “We can help this man!” he said. 
Van den Bosch realized he could put his company’s cranes to good use. Ever since, he has been driving them to nursing homes around Belgium. There, a family can stand on a platform that a crane operator will lift up to the window of a loved one. 
Eve Putseys came to see her 88-year-old aunt, who lives in La Cambre, a nursing home on the edge of the city of Brussels. 
Before she boarded the platform, Putseys didn’t know what to expect. “It’s been seven long weeks [that] I haven’t been able to see her,” she said. “It’s all quite emotional.”
But when Putseys returned to the ground, she was smiling. “I got to see her—and that was great,” she said. “She looked very happy to see me.”
Officials at La Cambre helped organize the crane-operated visit. “It has been hard work but quite rewarding,” director Thibaut Chevrier says. 
Van den Bosch admits that operating the machines costs his company money. But he has no regrets. “We’re happy that we have been able to help people,” he says.

557,557,Museums Closed,"{'Places', 'World'}","
About one in eight museums worldwide is at risk of permanently closing because of the COVID-19 pandemic. That’s according to the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and the International Council of Museums (ICOM). 
“It is alarming data that we are giving,” Ernesto Ottone Ramírez says. He’s assistant director-general for culture at UNESCO. The pandemic has forced about 90% of the world’s museums to close. That’s about 85,000 museums. Some are starting to reopen. Others may never be able to. After being closed for months, “they have no revenues,” or income, Ottone Ramírez says. Popular museums in Europe have lost up to 80% of their income.
The Museum of Fine Arts Ghent, in Belgium, had to close an exhibit of paintings by Jan van Eyck, an artist from the 15th century. The exhibit won’t reopen, since the paintings must be returned to their lenders.
The Louvre, in Paris, France, is the world’s most visited museum. It is home to the Mona Lisa, by Leonardo da Vinci. As of May 20, the museum remains closed. This comes even after France eased lockdown restrictions on May 11. The Uffizi, in Florence, Italy, is also closed. Even when these institutions do reopen, it’s not clear whether tourists will return.
The situation is especially tough in Latin America. There, Ottone Ramírez says, 99.4% of all museums are closed. “So you have a continent that doesn’t have anything open,” he says.
Reopenings in Europe, however, offer a glimmer of  hope. In Berlin, Germany, 10,000 visitors trickled into  several museums over the past week. That’s close to half the usual numbers. 
World leaders are showing their support. Sophie Wilmès is the prime minister of Belgium. On May 19, she toured the Bozar Centre for Fine Arts, in Brussels. She encouraged others to do the same. “[We have to] show that [museums] are open again and that people can come back here in complete safety.”

NASA is planning to launch the DART mission in 2021. DART stands for Double Asteroid Redirection Test. The goal of the mission is to see if NASA can change the course of objects in space, such as asteroids, that might hit Earth.
The DART spacecraft weighs 1,100 pounds. After it’s launched, it will crash into a space rock with the force of three tons of TNT. The space rock NASA is targeting is called Didymoon. That’s one of a pair of asteroids near the Earth. They travel around the sun together. Didymoon is 535 feet wide. It orbits the larger asteroid.
But a new study shows that a DART collision with Didymoon might create a meteor shower. The study appears in The Planetary Science Journal. This would be the first meteor shower caused by human activity.
Space Debris
According to the study, the spacecraft’s impact with Didymoon is expected to produce between 22,000 and 220,000 pounds of debris. Most of it will enter into the larger asteroid’s orbit. But some of it may come Earth’s way within 30 days of the crash. That would cause a meteor shower.
Paul Wiegert wrote the study. He’s an astronomy professor at the University of Western Ontario, in Canada. Wiegert thinks we might see a few grams of asteroid debris over a couple of days. That debris would result in “a few to 10” meteors, he told the New York Times.
Tom Statler is the program scientist for DART at NASA. He says the team’s analysis shows there is “no significant debris hazard” to Earth.
Astronomers say the DART mission will be a chance to see how human activity can affect activity in space. Aaron Boley is a planetary astronomer. He suggests moving the launch date for DART by a few weeks. This would lessen the chance of debris coming to Earth. “Space is big, but what we do in space can affect us,” Boley told the New York Times.

559,559,Back to the Races,"{'United States', 'Sports'}","
The engines were the only sound at the Darlington Raceway, in South Carolina, when NASCAR returned on Sunday. No fans were in the stadium to cheer for the 40 drivers and their crews. The event was called the Real Heroes 400. It was the first of 20 races between now and June 21. It was dedicated to healthcare workers fighting COVID-19. The name of the driver was replaced with that of a healthcare worker on the side of each car.
Kevin Harvick drove the winning car. “All of you frontline workers are the reason that we’re here today and our country is actually still running,” he told NBC Sports.
Safety First
Many safety measures were in place to protect drivers and crews. Only about 900 essential people were allowed inside the raceway. It can hold about 47,000 people. Each vehicle only had 16 employees assigned to it. Typically, a car would have more than 20.
Drivers were isolated until they arrived at their car. They were also given a health check four hours before the race, in case a backup driver was needed. And everyone was required to wear a face covering and have his or her temperature checked before entering the track.
“We didn’t have to tell anyone or remind anyone to wear a mask,” Steve O’Donnell told ESPN. He’s the executive vice president of NASCAR.
NASCAR’s health plan was approved by officials in North and South Carolina. Races are scheduled to take place in both states.
“I feel 100% comfortable with how things went today and that everybody is safe and everybody is able to go about their business and do their jobs and not have to worry about it,” said race-car driver Martin Truex Jr. to NBC Sports. “I have to commend NASCAR and everybody involved for what they did.”
“I want to thank everybody from NASCAR and all the teams for letting us do what we do,” Harvick said. “I didn’t think it was going to be that much different, [but] then we won the race and it’s dead silent out here. We miss the fans.”

560,560,Scoob's Big Adventure,"{'Movies and Television', 'Time Off'}","
A new movie dives into the origin story of your favorite dog detective. In Scoob!, watch as Scooby Doo meets his best human buddy, Shaggy, for the first time. You’ll see them go on to form the Scooby Gang, which includes Scooby, Shaggy, Velma, Fred, and Daphne. And then you’ll watch as the gang solves a big mystery involving a global “dog-pocalypse,” and you’ll discover that Scooby Doo has a secret destiny.
Tony Cervone directed the movie. “Scooby and Shaggy are a lot of fun,” he told TIME for Kids. “I think one of the reasons Scooby Doo has endured for so long is because of their friendship and the way they support each other.”
The film was scheduled to premiere in theaters on May 15. But the coronavirus pandemic caused a change of plans. Instead, Scoob! premieres today on video-streaming services.
“In the movie, there’s a lot about how change in your life affects friendship and how friendship grows and adapts to new situations,” Cervone says. “This is a huge challenge to kids all across the world right now. Kids are separated from their friends. That’s tough.”
Cervone thinks that because of this, viewers will connect to the movie. “What does it mean to be best friends if you’re not together?” he asks. “Can you still be best friends if you’re not in class together? The answer is yes, but how? That message became even more important.”

561,561,Sinking In,"{'History', 'Earth Science'}","
Everything was quiet at the Pantheon, in Rome, Italy, on the afternoon of April 27. That is, until the ground opened up outside the ancient temple and cobblestones fell into the earth.
No one was hurt. The normally crowded public square was empty because of the COVID-19 pandemic. So at first, there was no one to see what the sinkhole revealed: several 2,000-year-old paving stones. These slabs of rock were once part of a bustling ancient street.
“This is further evidence of Rome’s inestimable archaeological riches,” Daniela Porro told ANSA, the Italian news service. Porro is special superintendent of Rome.
The sinkhole measures about 10 square feet. The ancient stones lie eight feet below. Porro says they were laid around 27 to 25 B.C., making them as old as the original Pantheon built at this site. That temple was destroyed by fire, and then rebuilt circa 128 A.D. It is one of the best-preserved of Rome’s ancient structures.
The paving stones had been discovered once before, in the 1990s, when cables and pipelines were laid. 
On Dangerous Ground
Sinkholes have recently become a problem in Rome. In 2018, there were 175 of them in the city. The following year, there were another hundred. A sudden collapse can be dangerous. The largest sinkholes can swallow up cars and houses.
Sinkholes form when water wears away the rock beneath the streets. That puts Rome on shaky ground. The city sits on soft rock that is easily eroded. It is made even more unstable because of ancient tunnels and catacombs.
“The main cause of a sinkhole in the city is the presence of an underground cavity,” geologist Stefania Nisio told the Italian news agency Adnkronos. She is working on a project to map Rome’s sinkholes.
In 2018, city leaders put forth a plan to fix Rome’s streets, but progress on that has been slow. Until then, sinkholes will continue to hold the possibility of new discoveries. What wonder of the past could the next sinkhole in Rome unearth?

563,563,Chosen By Kids,"{'Books', 'Arts'}","
Wondering what book to start next? You’re in luck! The 2020 Children’s Choices Reading List was announced on May 1. This collection of nearly 100 fantastic books was chosen by 12,500 students. They are in kindergarten through sixth grade. They come from all over the United States. They read lots of newly published books. Then they voted for their favorites.
The list includes books for kids of all ages and reading levels—from picture books such as Little Taco Truck, by Tanya Valentine, to novels like Carolyn Mackler’s Not If I Can Help It. A number of graphic novels made the cut, too. These include New Kid, by Jerry Craft; The Crossover, by Kwame Alexander and illustrator Dawud Anyabwile; and Guts, by Raina Telgemeier. Fans of Jeff Kinney’s Wimpy Kid series will be pleased to see Diary of an Awesome Friendly Kid on the list. It’s told from the perspective of beloved sidekick Rowley Jefferson.
“The Children’s Choices list is such a fun project for all involved, especially teachers and kids across the country who get to read and keep amazing books for their classrooms,” Laura Peraza told TIME for Kids. She’s a senior manager at the Children’s Book Council (CBC).
The Children’s Choices Reading List is sponsored by the CBC and the International Literacy Association. Both groups promote reading and literacy. Along with releasing a Children’s Choices list each year, they compile a Young Adults’ Choices list. Those titles are chosen by teens in grades 7 through 12.
Many authors and illustrators with titles on the Children’s Choices list took to Twitter to express their excitement. “What an honor! Thank you!” wrote Joe McGee. He’s the author of Peanut Butter & Santa Claus: A Zombie Culinary Tale.
Josh Allen is the author of Out to Get You: 13 Tales of Weirdness and Woe. He also shared his thanks online. “A big thank you to the Children’s Book Council,” he wrote. “And a zillion thank yous to all the kids who voted for me!”

564,564,Camp Concerns,"{'Places', 'Community'}","
About 20 million children in the United States attend summer camp every year, according to the American Camp Association (ACA). They look forward to spending time there with friends.
But with social-distancing rules in effect across the U.S., many summer camps face tough decisions. Can they safely welcome campers this year? Do they need to close for the season? Or should they change how they carry out their programs?
“Most camps are not asking if they’re going to open, but how they’re going to open,” says Tom Rosenberg. He’s the president and CEO of the ACA. Rosenberg says that many camps are waiting on guidelines from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Camps are also taking advice from state and local health departments.
Beth Bye is the commissioner of the Connecticut Office of Early Childhood. On May 5, she announced that the state’s summer camps could open on June 29. But strict health guidelines will need to be in place. Most programs will not be allowed to have more than 30 kids.
Bye added that she believes camps are important for both kids and working parents. “For many families,” she told the New York Times, “summer camp is their childcare.”
In other parts of the country, some camps have already decided they must close for the summer. This was disappointing news for many young people. Delia Graham, 15, recently received notice that her camp, near Portland, Oregon, was canceled because of the COVID-19 pandemic. “I didn’t think it would get so bad, that it would last this long,” she says. “I really miss my friends.”
Other camps have chosen to move their programs online. The Girl Scouts of Oregon and Southwest Washington, for example, will start online activities for campers in June.
Allie Roberts is a director of programs there. “It’s a heartbreaking decision,” she says. “But it’s the right decision for the safety of our girls.”

565,565,Slow Reopening,"{'World', 'Health'}","
The coronavirus pandemic has had an enormous impact on our society. Besides its effect on the health of people around the world, it has also devastated the world economy. Many businesses and public places are closed. Millions of people have lost jobs. People are eager to return to their regular activities.
World leaders, especially in countries where COVID-19 struck earlier than in the United States, are taking the first steps toward reopening. But there and everywhere, that doesn’t mean life will go back to normal right away. Social-distancing rules will remain in place. And leaders will be paying close attention to the number of new COVID-19 cases. Many worry that reopening will lead to a new wave of infections.
“There is no fast way back to normal,” says Dr. Hans Kluge. He’s a director for the World Health Organization (WHO). Kluge and other health experts say reopening businesses and restarting public life must be done very carefully.
The WHO recommends that countries meet six conditions before restrictions are lifted. One is finding ways to prevent the virus from spreading in workplaces and schools. Another is making sure hospitals are prepared to test for and trace cases of COVID-19. The WHO says following these guidelines can help save lives and the economy.
In the U.S., some governors have begun loosening restrictions in their states. In Florida, Texas, and Nevada, businesses such as restaurants are reopening. In Georgia, some people are even headed back to the beach. “It seems like a lot of people are kind of excited to finally get out and get some sun,” says beachgoer Riley Monaghan. Even so, he is following health guidelines. “Be cautious,” he says. “Keep the distance. That’s still important.”
In parts of the country hit hardest by COVID-19, stay-at-home orders are still in place. Some states have even extended them. And in 48 states, schools are closed for the rest of the school year.
Students in some parts of the world have returned to class. Children in Sydney, Australia, went back on May 11. So did some younger kids in France. In Beijing, China, 82,000 students are back in school to prepare for high school entrance exams.

This story was updated on May 14, 2020. The number of students who are back in school in Beijing, China, was corrected. It is 82,000—not 32,000.

Have you been staying home a lot lately? You’re not alone. On Danger Force, a new series on Nickelodeon, even superheroes are staying home to help protect the world.
Danger Force is a spin-off of Nickelodeon’s Henry Danger. The show follows four kids with superpowers: Chapa, Miles, Mika, and Bose. They go to a special school called the Swellview Academy for the Gifted (S.W.A.G), where they learn how to control their powers and fight crime.
The show’s newest episode, “Quaran-kini,” was filmed and produced remotely, since the actors and crew were practicing social distancing to protect against COVID-19. In it, the characters must stay at home because of a gas leak. They meet on a video call to continue their training, but encounter a few issues along the way.
Dana Heath (pictured, top center) plays Mika. She told TIME for Kids that filming the episode was both challenging and rewarding. “At times, it could be very confusing since we were doing the whole episode on Zoom and we sometimes talked over each other,” Dana says. “Filming during the quarantine for me was very casual and less stressful because I was at home.”
The “Quaran-kini” episode airs May 9 on Nickelodeon.

567,567,New Black Hole,"{'Science', 'Space'}","
The European Southern Observatory (ESO) announced on May 6 that astronomers have found a black hole that is closer to Earth than any yet discovered.
The object is about 1,000 light-years away. It’s close enough that the two stars nearest to it can be seen without a telescope.
“An invisible object with a mass at least four times that of the sun can only be a black hole,” Thomas Rivinius said in a statement. He led the research, which was published in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics.
A thousand light-years may not seem close. A light-year is about 5.9 trillion miles. But in terms of our galaxy, this object is in the neighborhood. The next-closest black hole is about 3,200 light-years from Earth.
Black holes are usually the result of stars that have burned out. They are so massive that they have a strong gravitational pull. Nothing can escape this pull, not even light. That’s why we can’t see them. Scientists can only spot black holes because of the objects around them.  
The ESO astronomers noticed the stars around the black hole from La Silla Observatory, in Chile. They were studying a two-star system called HR 6819. They watched it for months, mapping the stars’ orbits. The way the stars moved told them something else was there.
Compared with other black holes, this one is small, about 25 miles across. “Washington, D.C., would quite easily fit into [it],” says astronomer Dietrich Baade. He is a co-author of the study. “And once it went in, it would never come back.”
Rivinius says the two stars are about 140 million years old. The black hole itself probably began forming 15 million years ago. Its discovery is the “tip of an exciting iceberg.” There could be more black holes near Earth.
Other astronomers agree. There may be 100 million to 1 billion of these objects in our galaxy. Avi Loeb is the director of Harvard University’s Black Hole Initiative. “It is most likely that there are black holes much closer than this one,” he says. “If you find an ant while scanning a tiny fraction of your kitchen, you know there must be many more out there.”

569,569,Empty Stadiums,"{'Sports', 'World'}","
Professional baseball players in South Korea returned to the field on May 5. For weeks, the season had been delayed because of the coronavirus pandemic. So this opening day was unusual. That’s because no fans were allowed into the stadiums. They will not be permitted to return until the risk of infection is lower.
“The players just really wanted to play baseball,” Kim Hyun-soo says. He’s an outfielder for the LG Twins. “We are delighted to do just that.” 
By May 6, South Korea was seeing only single-digit increases in COVID-19 cases each day. The South Korean government has begun loosening social distancing rules. But measures are in place to create safe conditions on the field. Players go through fever screenings before entering the stadium. Umpires and some coaches wear protective masks. 
At one opening-day game, a 9-year-old boy “threw” the ceremonial first pitch. Inside a plastic bubble made to look like a baseball, he walked from the pitcher’s mound to home plate. The batter tapped the bubble with his bat. 
With no fans around, some teams got creative. The SK Wyverns decked the outfield seats with banners that showed faces wearing team gear.

A few fans couldn’t keep away. Cho Ki-hyun was outside the stadium. He watched the game on a tablet. “I am delighted just to hear the sounds of a baseball game from outside,” he told the Associated Press.
“It would have been better if [fans] could be with us,” said Na Sung-bum. He’s an outfielder with the NC Dinos. “But I am glad that we delivered something good to fans watching TV.” 
The games have aired on ESPN in the United States, aimed at people who miss American baseball. The 2020 Major League Baseball season remains delayed because of the pandemic. In April, league commissioner Rob Manfred talked to Fox Business network. He said baseball won’t return “until the public health situation is improved [and] we can play games in a manner that is safe for our players, our employees, our fans.”

In March, as schools were closing to slow the spread of COVID-19, a new website was launched called Eldera. Eldera was designed to help people make connections even while practicing social distancing. It pairs kids with adults 60 and over for tutoring and conversation. “We’re building what we call a virtual village,” Dana Griffin, one of Eldera’s founders, told TIME for Kids. “Each and every connection brings so much joy to the kids and to the elders.” To learn more about Eldera, TFK Kid Reporter Nora Wilson-Hartgrove registered for the service and did a session. She writes about her experience below.
As of May 4, 72% of students around the world were out of school because of COVID-19. That means many of us are dealing with remote learning, and that we probably have some extra time on our hands.
Eldera is a new service offering help during this difficult time. The website matches kids with elders. These volunteers are 60 years old and over. Once a kid and an elder have been paired, Eldera brings them together over Zoom. It gives them a chance to connect.
Kids can choose to be tutored in math or reading, to have the elder tell them stories, or just to have a conversation. With my dad’s help, I signed up so I could learn firsthand about Eldera and write about it for TIME for Kids. 
The first step is to ask a parent to register with their name and email address. Then Eldera asks your parent some questions about what you’re interested in and when you’re available. Before long, your parent gets an email telling her or him about the elder you’ve been matched with. All the elders are vetted by Eldera to make sure the process is safe. Then the Eldera team schedules your first session and sends a link to a virtual meeting room.  
When I met my elder partner, Jackie, we had a great time. She told me two stories, and we had a nice conversation. We talked about how stories can seem silly and distracting. But they can also remind us of how people have made it through hard times in the past. 
I would recommend Eldera to kids and adults who love to interact with people and need something to look forward to right now. It’s a fun way to interact with new people. After six weeks at home, Eldera was like a quarantine escape for me!

Zoos and aquariums around the world are closed to slow the spread of COVID-19. Without the money they normally bring in from ticket sales, many are struggling financially.
So some of these institutions are turning to the Internet. They’re finding new ways to raise money while letting people connect with animals from home.
The Phoenix Zoo, in Arizona, houses a 4-year-old Linné’s two-toed sloth. His name is Fernando. After the zoo shut down, on March 18, it added Fernando to Cameo. That’s a video-sharing website where people pay for celebrity shout-outs. In this case, Fernando is the celebrity. Zookeepers record videos of him in his habitat while someone reads a personalized note for a Cameo customer.
“I think we’ve gotten more creative, kind of thinking a little bit outside the box. We’re trying things we never have before,” Bert Castro says. He’s the president and CEO of the Phoenix Zoo.
So far, Fernando has gotten more than 150 video requests. He’s so popular that the zoo was able to raise his fee from $25 to $50 per shout-out.
Still, Fernando’s earnings are just a drop in the bucket. Since the zoo closed its gates, it has been losing $80,000 a day.
“They can’t just send their employees home and turn off the lights and lock the doors. They have to care for animals,” Dan Ashe says. He is president of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA).
All of the 220 zoos and aquariums that belong to the AZA have closed because of the pandemic. Around 60% of them have laid off some employees. Many have applied for government loans. Social media can’t replace all of the zoos’ lost income. But officials say every dollar helps.
The Phoenix Zoo isn’t alone in finding creative ways to make money. The Toronto Zoo, in Canada, is livestreaming happenings such as red panda weigh-ins. The Oakland Zoo, in California, launched an online subscription model. It features behind-the-scenes videos. And the Monterey Bay Aquarium, also in California, has filmed meditation videos for YouTube, featuring the relaxing sights and sounds of ocean creatures.

Even during a global health emergency, teachers continue to educate, encourage, and inspire students. They’re finding new ways to connect with learners, and we’re amazed by their creativity and persistence in spite of the many challenges they face. To kick off Teacher Appreciation Week, we asked our team of TFK Kid Reporters to tell us how their teachers are going the extra mile during this trying time. Read their notes below. 

Mrs. Williams, my seventh-grade engineering instructor, is an outstanding teacher. Like many other students, we’re learning electronically because of the pandemic. Mrs. Williams lets us share our thoughts and discuss things, and she gave us helpful hints on how to move forward with online learning. She also created a virtual NASA field trip last week. We learned how long the space shuttle Atlantis was in space, how many times it went into space, and about the International Space Station. Mrs. Williams continues to make the best of the situation by being creative to keep us engaged. Thanks a lot for guiding and inspiring me. Mr. Sears, my principal, has made sure his students stay connected through different activities. During the fourth week of our being out of school, Mr. Sears set up the STEM Stays Home Challenge. Some of the activities included Miss You Monday, where we emailed our teachers about what we’d miss from their classes. He also organized a trivia evening based on fun facts about our school, and it was a great way for us to reconnect with our beloved classmates. —By Alexis Bumah
My teachers must have been under lots of pressure to create an online learning program with almost no warning, but they did it and have made it fun, too. They’ve gone above and beyond to make students feel comfortable in this hard time. One thing they’ve added is live office hours. In addition to our regular live classes, our teachers have created meetings where we can ask about assignments or just talk. My homeroom teacher, Ms. Connaughton, has set up extra small-group meetings on Fridays. She uses this time to ask about our well-being and how school is going for us. It has meant a lot to me that she wants to hear our feedback and make the next week even better. And she cares enough about me as a person that she wants to hear how I’m doing during a challenging time. Our teachers have also created projects to help keep us occupied and excited about school. Our librarian, Ms. Lee, made an online bulletin board where students can write news stories at any time, which has allowed me to do my favorite thing: report news! —By Henry Carroll
This pandemic has been a real wrench in the works of all of our lives, but our teachers are looking past that to keep teaching us to the best of their abilities. The ones at my school all became expert Zoomers! They had to change their lesson plans so they could teach them online. And they are still helping students with homework, giving out good study tips, and just trying to be there for any student in need. Our teachers are going above and beyond the call of duty. My Spanish teacher, Señora Tarraso, emailed me when my assignment wasn’t turned in correctly. My art teacher, Ms. Finch, knew that I was doing the work, but emailed me when it wasn’t showing up as turned in. And finally, my principal, Ms. Koscik, helped me when I was having trouble getting into my virtual meetings. Those are just a few examples. Thanks to all the teachers out there for bringing their creativity, positivity, and sometimes even their pets! —By Jack Doane

I am so blessed to be a student at my school. My teachers Ms. Tallman and Ms. Collins prepare a syllabus each day to give students detailed reading and homework assignments. They also host online sessions to answer students’ questions. Their support makes sure students continue to learn during this difficult time without burdening parents too much. On top of academics, the school also cares about our mental and physical health. It hosts hangout sessions during which students can read together in virtual book clubs, socialize, laugh, play online games, and enjoy themselves. The syllabus always includes instructions for physical exercise, such as stretching and jumping rope. Our principal, Mr. Finch, even makes videos of himself climbing playground structures to encourage students to exercise. I also appreciate the weekly letters that he writes to encourage people in the community to support one another, stay patient, and take quiet time to reflect. —By Priscilla L. Ho
Although COVID-19 closed our campus, learning continues. Teachers at my school invested an enormous amount of time and effort to make the shift to distance learning an exciting one for all of us. I am particularly touched and inspired by my English teacher, Mr. Peden. His handwriting is impeccable, and his jokes and puns are amazing. Mr. Peden doesn’t need technology to hold his students’ attention and make his classes enriching and entertaining. He has taught English for more than 40 years at my school, and I’ve only seen him use our SmartBoard a few times. But shifting to online learning, Mr. Peden has been excited to learn the new software and technology, and continues to teach us the work of his favorite author, Shakespeare, virtually. Thank you so much, Mr. Peden; all of your students know you have a passion for teaching, and we’re forever grateful for you! And I’m thankful to every single one of my teachers for making this shift to distance learning so seamless, easy, and fun. —By Eshaan Mani
During this time of uncertainty and fear, Mrs. Holler is doing a lot to help the fifth graders she teaches. In addition to posting detailed instructional videos online that help guide students through each assignment, she is very quick to respond to emails and to answer questions. She does everything she can to ensure kids are successful with their work. She provides positive and constructive feedback on every assignment we turn in, making us feel great about our work and giving excellent advice about fixing and learning from mistakes. Mrs. Holler makes our virtual class meetings every Friday morning fun, with activities and catch-ups. She has helped me grow as a student and as a person, and I, along with many others, am so grateful for the work she has done. —By Mira McInnes
Because of the coronavirus, I have been learning online for the past four weeks. It has been really different and sometimes a mess, but my teachers have always been there for me. For one thing, during regular class, they always make sure to answer everyone’s questions. They have even set aside time for us to catch up with one another and share what’s happening. With our work, my teachers—Ms. Killory for math and Ms. Walsh for homeroom—always make it clear what we need to do, and when. If I’m having trouble, I can send them an email and they respond quickly. One helpful thing is that they review the classwork and make sure we all know how to access everything and submit the assignments. If I ever have trouble submitting something or getting into the virtual meetings, they help me out and are understanding. While this is all new, it is so much easier to get work done and juggle everything, knowing my teachers have my back. —By Tyler Mitroff
Teachers are always a big part of a student’s life. But now that we’re stuck in this dire situation from the highly contagious COVID-19, they’re going above and beyond. The whole community is working together like never before. Our principal holds a daily mindfulness session, where we get to calm down before we start the day. Teachers conduct virtual meetings, where we get to play games and see our friends. The principal offers weekly prizes on the school website. Sometimes, these are store coupons, which encourage families to shop at local stores. Our district superintendent gave all the masks in the science department to the local hospitals. The district is providing free pickup lunches for the students at our school. Our teachers are hosting games and sing-alongs for the students, and offering motivational quotes. And they are always there for us, not just academically, but emotionally. As this virus tries to split us apart, we will unite. I am part of not just a school or a district but a community. This virus won’t stop our laughter. No matter what happens, we will persevere. —By Raunak Singh

Imagine you’re out for a walk with your family when a strange dog approaches you. The dog isn’t , but it seems to want something. It nudges you with its snout, and barks.
What you don’t know is that this dog is trained to help a person with a medical condition. Its owner has collapsed. The dog has run off to find help. That’s you! But how can the dog make you understand what’s wrong?
Now imagine the dog is wearing a  vest. There’s a rope attached: The dog uses its teeth to tug on it. This plays an audio recording. It says something like: “My owner needs help.” You’d know to follow the dog to its owner.
This is the goal of the FIDO project. That’s an ongoing study at the Georgia Institute of Technology.

New Tricks
Dogs can be trained to do many tasks. For example, epilepsy alert dogs fetch help if their owner has a seizure. Epilepsy is a condition that can cause a person to lose consciousness and twitch uncontrollably. Allergy dogs can smell a life-threatening allergen nearby. Diabetes dogs know when their owner’s blood sugar is dangerously low.
FIDO stands for Facilitating Interactions for Dogs with Occupations. The team wants to make it easier for working dogs to do their job. “Technology can give dogs so much more power as they help their humans,” Melody Jackson told TIME for Kids. She’s the director of FIDO.

FIDO researchers designed a vest with a tiny computer built in. It can call 911 or play an audio recording, among other things. The next step was to figure out how a dog would  it.
The team made several sensors and put them on a . There was a touch sensor. It’s similar to the touch screen on a smartphone. A dog taps it with its nose. Another had a rope for the dog to tug with its mouth. There was also a proximity sensor. A dog activates it with a movement of its snout. Another sensor is activated when a dog bites down on it.
“Then we tested them all with all types of dogs—everything from a border collie to a basset hound to a poodle,” Jackson says. “We were able to train all the dogs to use all the sensors in 27 minutes or less.”
Work in Progress
For now, FIDO’s technology is being tested in the lab. Jackson is in talks with companies that are interested in making the devices. She hopes that soon, dogs will wear high-tech vests on the job. “How many dogs can use cell phones?” she says. “Well, ours can, and that means they can save a person’s life.”

Best Medicine
Wynn is a year-old Labrador retriever. She’s training to be a service dog. Her handler, Dr. Susan Ryan, is an emergency doctor in Denver, Colorado. While Ryan works, Wynn hangs out in a hospital office. When COVID-19 hit, hospital workers felt anxious. Many started visiting Wynn. Ryan says petting Wynn helps manage stress. “We get anxious when we think about the future,” Ryan told TFK. “Wynn helps us return to the present.”

575,575,COVID-19 Testing,"{'Government', 'Health'}","
Americans have been following stay-at-home orders for weeks. Many are eager to get back to work. The coronavirus pandemic has caused 22 million people to lose jobs. Governors face pressure to reopen businesses in their states.
But health experts say more testing for COVID-19 must happen first. About 150,000 people in the United States are tested each day. That’s according to the COVID Tracking Project. Researchers say this has to triple before restrictions are .
On April 20, Vice President Mike Pence talked to governors. He said the federal government is “here to help.” Some governors say the federal government isn’t providing enough test kits. Lack of testing is “the Number 1 problem,” Larry Hogan says. He’s the governor of Maryland.
Dr. Anthony Fauci is the nation’s top infectious-disease expert. “Unless we get the virus under control,” he says, “the real recovery economically is not going to happen.”

576,576,Teens Build Ventilators,"{'Young Game Changers', 'World'}","
Afghanistan is facing the coronavirus pandemic with few resources. The country has only 400 ventilators for a population of about 37 million. These machines help people who are very sick and having trouble breathing. 
A girls’ robotics team in the city of Herat is working on a solution. The girls are building ventilators out of batteries, manual oxygen pumps, and windshield-wiper motors from old cars. The team members are between 14 and 17 years old. Somaya Farooqi, 17, is one of them. “If we even save one life with our device, we will be proud,” she says.
Roya Mahboob started the team. She works to empower Afghan girls. She hopes the teens will complete a model ventilator this month or next. It will then be sent to Afghanistan’s Ministry of Public Health for testing.

577,577,8 Questions for Dr. Oxiris Barbot,"{'People', 'Health'}","
New York City is the  of the COVID-19 crisis in the United States. It’s also where TFK Kid Reporter Zara Wierzbowski lives. She wanted to know more about how her city is handling the situation. On April 22, Zara spoke with New York City’s health commissioner, Dr. Oxiris Barbot, to get answers to her questions. Read their conversation below.
1. The number of new COVID-19 cases here in New York City seems to be going down. What do we need to keep it that way? 
How fast the number of cases continues to go down depends on every single one of us. Every New Yorker has a role to play in bringing this outbreak to an end. The most important thing every New Yorker can do is to stay home and to only go out for essential reasons, like going to the grocery store or the doctor. If someone needs to go out, we want them to wear face coverings. These face coverings can be cloth. They should cover the nose and the mouth. And even when folks are wearing face coverings, they should stay six feet from other people.
One of the things I hope comes out of this really difficult time is that we realize the important role every single one of us has in ensuring not only our own health and the health of our families, but also the health of our communities. We’re all in this together.
2. How have officials in New York City been handling this pandemic differently than the rest of the country?
In many ways, we’re all going about this in a very similar fashion. We’re making sure Americans have all of the information they need in order to understand what’s happening and how to stay safe. This pandemic is something no one has ever been a part of. Every day, it feels like we’re learning new information. What we’ve been learning is that this information, and the way in which we need to tell Americans to protect themselves, has been  over time.
Many officials are directing their cities to do what we’re doing [in New York City], which is to shelter in place. By reducing the amount of mixing people do outside, we reduce the chances of continuing the spread. 
3. How do you feel about schools in New York City closing?
As a pediatrician and a public health leader, and as someone who has kids in my life, I think it's a hard thing. We've all had to adjust to a new reality, and I'm afraid that there are going to be kids who don’t have all of the access they need in order to continue their learning. 
As a city, we’re doing a lot to help kids keep up. We don't want children to lose learning opportunities. But the reality is that [closing schools] was one of the things we needed to do. My hope is that by putting these strong social-distancing measures in place, when it comes time to start opening up the city, we won't have as many people getting sick.
4. When will stores and businesses start to reopen?
There are a couple of things that need to be in place first. We need to make sure that the percentage of people who test positive for COVID-19 goes down. We need to make sure that the number of people being hospitalized because of COVID-19 continues to go down, as well as the number of people who end up in the intensive care unit—meaning the folks who are really, really sick. And when we start getting ready to open back up, we need to make sure that our health-care system can absorb the number of people who may end up getting sick. 
5. You recently said that after the pandemic ends, we need to focus on making sure that “health is not a byproduct of privilege.” What did you mean by that? Do you feel the coronavirus has highlighted differences in how people are treated?
Sometimes people who don't have access to good medical care, to healthy housing, to good transportation, and to good food, have a disadvantage in fighting COVID-19. We’re seeing that they're the ones who are suffering the most. And the reality is that it doesn't even have anything to do with the virus itself. It has more to do with the impact of having limited access to the kinds of things that promote health, like opportunities for good jobs and good education, and access to health insurance.
COVID-19 is bringing to light inequities that are going on in our country every day. But the good thing is that in spite of our differences, this is our opportunity to come together. We can plan to move forward in a way that can make our city and country even stronger, so that these differences don't persist.
6. I've heard a lot about the shortage of masks and protective equipment in hospitals. Is this still a problem in New York City?
This has been a concern of ours from the beginning. We, as the health department and as a city, do a lot in terms of ensuring that our frontline workers have the equipment they need in order to be safe. We have worked with our partners in the state and federal governments to make sure that the supply of critical equipment to our doctors, our nurses, and our ambulance drivers, continues. This is going to be an ongoing struggle, one that we're paying close attention to. 
7. I've also heard about antibody testing, but I don't know what it is. Can you explain it? 
Part of our body's reaction to fighting an infection is that it launches a response. As part of that response, our body makes antibodies. Whenever someone has antibodies against something, it means that their body was exposed to a new virus and fought against it. Now [there is] evidence in the blood that they cleared that infection. 
But COVID-19 is a part of a family of viruses, and in that family there are seven different strains. Four of them cause the common cold. Two cause really terrible illnesses that thankfully we don't see very often. And somewhere in the middle, we have COVID-19. The issue with these new COVID-19 antibody tests that are being developed is that it’s hard to tell whether the antibodies are to COVID-19 or to the common cold. Hopefully, in the near future, we'll get better tests that will help us develop a better strategy to protect people against COVID-19 and to give them assurances about what kind of immunity they may have.
8. Is there anything else you’d like TIME for Kids readers to know?
There's a lot of stuff out there on TV and in newspapers and on the Internet about COVID-19 that can sound really scary. It’s understandable to feel anxious or have nightmares when something new and scary comes out. I want kids to know that all of that is normal. I want them to talk to their parents about what they may be feeling. It’s a good idea to take a break from TV and the Internet to focus on other things, because it can all be a little overwhelming.

578,578,8 Questions for Andrew Morgan,"{'Science', 'Space'}","
Astronaut Andrew Morgan took a 272-day trip to the International Space Station (ISS). He conducted seven spacewalks and orbited the Earth 4,352 times before returning on April 17. Morgan talked with TFK Kid Reporters Henry Carroll, Priscilla L. Ho, and Mira McInnes.
1. Priscilla: “What was it like to return to Earth, with all the COVID-19–related restrictions?”
Within 24 hours of landing in Kazakhstan, I was back in Houston, Texas. Now I’m in a quarantine facility at Johnson Space Center. They’re running tests to make sure my immune system is healthy enough for me to go home to my family.
2. Henry: “Did you follow the news from space?”
I sure did. My two crewmates and I watched streaming news and taped news reports. We knew the Earth would change while we were away. But this was more dramatic than we expected.
3. Mira: “Was it hard being away from family?”
We could make phone calls or do video chats. I spoke to my wife and kids almost every day. I’m also a military officer. I was  overseas and have been separated from my family before. So it wasn’t new to me.
4. Priscilla: “What do ISS crews talk about?”
On the ISS, we captured visiting vehicles and unloaded cargo. We did spacewalks and science experiments. There was a lot to talk about.

5. Henry: “What’s the most interesting thing you observed while in space?”
I’d say it was the Earth. There are windows on the ISS that are pointed toward Earth so we can make observations. We also see  around the Earth—the aurora borealis, the moon and stars.
6. Henry: “Any surprises upon returning home?”
Earth still feels the same, even though it is facing a global crisis. It was beautiful from above, and it’s beautiful, still, on the ground. It is still worth returning to.
7. Mira: “After 272 days in space, how would you advise kids who find social distancing hard?”
It’s hard to imagine that life will ever be normal again. But as a nation, as a planet, we have endured tough times before. We’ll get to the other side of this, and life will feel normal again.
8. Priscilla: “What message do you have for kids?”
When we looked down from the ISS, we saw an Earth without borders. There are problems that affect us all equally, in spite of borders. COVID-19 is just one of them. Just as we do on the ISS, we can work together as nations to solve those problems.

579,579,Soap Challenge,"{'Technology', 'Inventions'}","
Handwashing just got competitive. Jennifer George has issued a challenge: Find a creative way to drop a bar of soap into someone’s hand. The catch? Participants must do so in 10 to 20 steps by creating their own Rube Goldberg machine.
“A Rube Goldberg machine is a ridiculously complicated contraption that, in the end, does a very simple task,” George told TIME for Kids. She is Rube Goldberg’s granddaughter. She’s also the legacy director of Rube Goldberg Inc.
The Man, the Legend
Rube Goldberg was an inventor and an award-winning newspaper cartoonist. He was born in 1883. He drew about 50,000 cartoons in his career. He also liked eating giant bowls of whipped cream. And he wore shoes while swimming.

Goldberg is best known for his humorous drawings of elaborate devices. They include a self-operating napkin and an automatic back-scratcher. He “trained as an engineer,” George says. “So the way he thought would creep into his art.”
Challenge Accepted
Since 1988, Rube Goldberg Inc. has hosted competitions for students. But this year, plans changed because of the COVID-19 pandemic. “It dawned on me that parents and kids are suddenly at home with all this time on their hands,” George says.
So the Rube Goldberg Bar of Soap Video Challenge was born. To enter, contestants must create an unedited video of their machine in action. It should show every step in the process, with a bar of soap dropping into a person’s hand at the end.
Goldberg made a career of drawing complex inventions. But here’s a surprising fact: He never built them. “I think he would be really amused that we’re all sitting here now trying to build these machines in his name,” George says.

583,583,The History of Pandemics,"{'World', 'History'}","
The new coronavirus pandemic is historic. But this isn’t the first time a virus has sickened people around the globe. Pandemics have happened throughout history.
The most recent pandemic started just over a decade ago, in 2009, with the outbreak of a new kind of H1N1 flu called the swine flu. The illness most likely started in North America, and it quickly spread around the world.
Swine flu wasn’t nearly as deadly as the coronavirus. That made it much easier to control. Governments did not have to issue stay-at-home orders like we are seeing today. By late 2009, vaccines were available to prevent people from becoming sick. 
Throughout History
Before the modern era of pandemics, the United States was hit hard by yellow fever, which arrived in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1793. Yellow fever attacks a person’s liver and kidneys. The disease got its name because it causes the skin to take on a yellow tint. 
Back then, scientists didn’t understand what caused yellow fever or how it spread, which made it difficult to stop the outbreak. But when the weather in Philadelphia cooled down in the fall, the outbreak let up. That’s because yellow fever is spread by mosquitoes, which aren’t active in cold weather—though scientists wouldn’t learn that until a century later. Today, yellow fever can be prevented with a vaccine. The disease is no longer a concern in the U.S., but people traveling to parts of Africa and South America may be required to take precautions. 
In 1918, a true pandemic hit, caused by a new kind of flu called the Spanish flu. (The disease didn’t actually start in Spain, but newspapers there were among the first to report on it. So people started calling it the Spanish flu, and the name stuck.)
Experts believe that one third of the world’s population was infected with the Spanish flu. Many historians have compared it to the new coronavirus. “They’re similar in the way they infect people,” historian John Barry told TIME for Kids. “They’re similar in the way they spread.” Both the coronavirus and Spanish flu can affect a person’s lungs. And they both spread when a person coughs, sneezes, or talks. 
Stopping the Spread
During the Spanish flu pandemic, the U.S. put in place restrictions similar to those we’re seeing today. People were asked to wear face masks and encouraged to wash their hands. Officials limited large gatherings and ordered people to quarantine themselves. 
“Quarantine is centuries and centuries old,” says Katherine Foss. She’s an author and professor who has studied pandemics throughout history. “It’s the number-one practice that is used to stop an outbreak. And it works even when scientists don’t know what is making people sick.”
Science has come a long way since 1918. Back then, doctors didn’t even have microscopes that were powerful enough to let them see the viruses that cause pandemics. Today, scientists and doctors have advanced technology to help them battle the new coronavirus. “But since we’re dealing with a brand-new virus that nobody has ever seen before, it still takes time to develop vaccines and treatments using modern medicine,” Barry says. “In the meantime, the only thing left to fight it with are public-health measures like quarantine.” 
Barry says that although there have been many pandemics throughout history, kids should understand that this one is unusually severe. 
“This is something you’re going to remember for the rest of your life,” he says. “This is not ordinary. This is a special time that requires special courage. You have an opportunity to rise to greatness. Social distancing matters, and it saves lives.”

584,584,News from Our Readers: April 2020,"{'The View', 'Community'}","
What are your thoughts, feelings, and opinions about the global coronavirus emergency? We asked our readers to let us know at tfkeditors@time.com, with the permission of a parent, teacher, or guardian. Here, we'll share some responses.
Updated April 21
From Riya M., age 6, in Rochester Hills, Michigan:

From Araina P., age 9, in Wayne, Pennsylvania:
I remember the first time my teacher said the word COVID-19. It sounded scary. She told us how dangerous the coronavirus was and asked us to be careful. I am not scared of the virus, but I know I have to be careful so that I do not catch it. 
My family and I have been washing hands frequently and practicing social distancing for a few weeks now. I have read up on it, and my parents tell me that if we all practice social distancing we will win against the virus. That's why I have been staying home with my parents which is actually a lot of fun.
After getting used to being home for a few days, I started doing activities that keep me entertained and happy. My family and I watched movies and played board games, went for walks, and also did some DIY projects like building my own walking robot. We also have online LEGO challenges in our community, and I won twice. I keep in touch with all my friends and cousins through video messaging, practice my cello, and do all my school activities online. 
Staying at home has made me realize that this is a perfect time to bond with your family. If we keep practicing social distancing, we can all get over this, so hang in tight and stay safe.
From Ben W., age 9, in Westborough, Massachusetts:
The last five weeks have been very different than usual. I have been learning at home with help from my parents. I can only see my classmates and teachers through Google Meet. I haven’t been to the store in a while. My mom does all of the shopping while I stay at home with my dad. Now my mom wears a mask when she shops. She said at the beginning it was rare to see a mask, and now it’s the opposite—it is rare not to see someone wearing one.
While I am at home, I play video games, do schoolwork, and help clean. I am also building a robot that I got for Christmas. Since my parents are both working from home, we have a lot of time together. We usually go for walks after dinner with my dog. I bet my dog and cat are confused because normally nobody is home and now everyone is! 
I like being home, but I also know what is happening in the world. For example we are lucky that my parents can work from home, but I know some kids’ parents are out of work and may have trouble buying groceries. My family helps by donating money so other people can buy food. I know I am also lucky because although I am not in school I am still learning. Because of technology I am able to do schoolwork and will be ready for fifth grade.
Since I have been home, we have had Easter. This year was very different. Normally my family gets together and I see my aunts, uncles, and cousins. This year, we stayed home and had a video chat with everyone while they stayed at their homes. It might not have been normal, but it was unique and still great.
The coronavirus has affected everyone, from young to old. The best thing we can do is stay inside, sanitize our hands, and social distance. Every person needs to do their part. By staying away, we can beat this together!
From Eliza K., age 8, in Orlando, Florida:
I remember when I first heard on the news that the virus was affecting people in other countries. At school, we started learning more about germs and getting into the habit of washing our hands more. I didn’t think how much it would affect the people of the United States.
Then everyone got serious—well, my family did. During spring break we had plans to go to the beach. Our trip was canceled! My parents said that we would stay at home until it got a little better. What did that mean? When would it be a little better?
Now it is my second week of virtual school. It makes me sad because I don’t get to see my friends, I don’t get to go to school, I don’t get to play volleyball with my team, and I don’t get to play with my neighbors. But it is not all so bad. I have learned so much about the computer and email and Google. 
My day-to-day routine starts in the morning. I go through the house to the dining room and try to watch YouTube before anyone wakes up—but my mom always catches me! Then I have to start working. When I am halfway through, I get a little break. I sometimes like to go in our backyard and sit on the swing. Some days are so hot, I am told not to go outside and to read a book instead. When I am done with all my work online, I get to do P.E. videos. 
On the weekends, we go swimming because I don’t have school. My mom tries to plan some activities like making slime but she isn’t so good at it. We are together at least, and that makes me happy. I hope everyone can be happy and share the love because we all need it!  
From Julia S., age 13, in Southgate, Michigan:

From Madelynn A., age 12, in Englewood, Colorado:
The coronavirus has prevented me from having a sleepover with my friends for my 12th birthday. And it postponed our out-of state family members from visiting us here in Colorado. Other than that, I've been having a lot of fun. My mom is off of work, so after I finish remote learning, we do some fun stuff. I usually occupy myself by playing with the cat, sleeping, watching TikTok compilations, and playing The Sims 4. 
Even if kids don’t always feel like they are important, they can help their family and their community in big ways. They can prevent the coronavirus from spreading by practicing social distancing, making sure to wash their hands, and keeping their hands away from their faces.
If my friends are perhaps reading this, I do want to say that I really miss them. And I really want to thank the people who are in important jobs and are still working. For example, my dad. He makes cool stuff for cats and dogs.
From Olivia P., age 10, in Mill Bay, British Columbia, Canada
First of all, l am enjoying my stay at home. Mostly because I do not have to take the crazy loud bus in the early morning every day. Instead, I get to stay in my warm bed a bit longer. Also, taking class online at home is something that interests me. I have never done classes online before, so this is something new.
On the other side, I am scared of the coronavirus. I have seen many news reports and articles saying how dangerous the virus is. Whenever the number of people with the virus increases, I get very worried. 
But I am trying to see the bright side of things. My family and I are doing our best to keep our bodies healthy and strong. We do laps around the house, play badminton, and practice Taekwondo moves. Most importantly, we drink lots of hot ginger tea with honey.
I know many people around the world are as scared as I am. I am very thankful that people around me are safe and healthy. Fingers crossed for everyone!
From Adrian G., age 5, in Miami, Florida:
I have enjoyed making cookies with my mommy and brother during the coronavirus. I like going outside and riding my brother's kid car. I like jumping on rocks that we found on a morning walk on the side of the road. I like exploring animals too. We have explored ants, birds, lizards, butterflies, dogs, and bees. 
I liked making an electrical circuit kit that we have at home. My brother and I made up a new game where you catch the fan of the electrical circuit with a wooden stick. 
My birthday was last week. I didn't get to have a birthday party, but I got presents and I had lots of fun with my brother and parents. We ordered pizza and watched a movie and drank soda and ate ice cream with gummy bears. 
My dad works in the hospital as a doctor and we can't hug him when he comes home until he takes a shower. He is at the hospital many times until nighttime. But overall, this has been a fun time with my brother and my parents.
From Ella B., age 9, in Dallas, Texas:
My life has changed a lot since the beginning of the coronavirus [pandemic]. One of the biggest changes is that I am doing my schoolwork from home. Like the student in the story “Kids Report on COVID-19: Eshaan in Texas,” I am taking walks with my family, hand sanitizing, and washing my hands a lot. I am also enjoying some fun things, like Cosmic Kids yoga with my mom and sister and cooking at home with my family since we aren’t going to restaurants. 
A recent activity that was really fun was having a “Zoom Party” with my aunt to celebrate my dog Lizzie’s 8th birthday. We all ate dinner together and then played charades and dares. Our dogs enjoyed “puppaccinos” (whipped cream) and special bones. We even sang “Happy Birthday” to my dog. Even though my life is different, I am trying to do some things the same and also enjoying new activities at home.
From Sophie I., age 10, in Poughkeepsie, New York:
It wasn’t a big deal for a while, but suddenly it was apparent: COVID-19 was going to be a big deal. I knew about it early because my dad’s work takes him on business trips often. Once, he went to China. One day my parents were talking about how China was so deeply affected, that schools were closing and everybody was in quarantine. I was worried, but my mom told me that travel to and from China was restricted and the country was shutting down, so COVID-19 would not reach us. 
About a week later, I heard from my friends that the coronavirus had hit California, and then Boston. I was frightened, but it wasn’t in New York yet. I was really hoping that it wouldn't affect anyone, or anywhere, else. But suddenly it was everywhere. Next thing I know, my school is closed for two weeks. Everyone is saying it will be longer than that. 
My friend’s mom works at a hospital, and they actually ran out of masks. We’re working to sew new ones using extra fabric. Every store you go to, they’re sold out of toilet paper, hand sanitizer, and rubbing alcohol. I can’t go to any after-school or weekend activities. During the week, my mom has to do a sort of homeschooling to keep us learning. A lot of my schoolwork is on the computer. I haven't left my house in four days.
I have been very anxious about this, but I have a few things I do to keep my mind off of it: I watch American Ninja Warrior Junior when new episodes premiere. I play games on my computer. I watch the Cincinnati Zoo’s live animal report at 3pm every day, and I do a lot of reading. It’s not easy to be in this situation, but there are a lot of things that can help.
From Eva Mae G., age 8, in Nashville, Tennessee:
I am wondering what children my age are doing for fun since they can’t go to school or go on field trips. I like to make art and hope the new coronavirus stops spreading. My family has been at home for over two weeks and we do a lot of reading, playing games, and making art.

From Hattie I., age 12, in Midlothian, Virginia:
I remember the first time I started to hear about the coronavirus. My family wasn't very worried, in fact, we were skeptical about whether it was even coming to the U.S. Then, in a matter of days, life was thrown completely off course. Everything was canceled. Lucky for us, we're homeschooled, so when school was canceled, it didn't change a lot for us. My dad still has to work because he's a doctor.
Life after school is completely different. Usually, we have lots of activities at night, but now there's nothing! We have a lot of time to play outside. The other day my four siblings and I had a magic/sword battle after we roasted marshmallows. It was really fun!
Even though I can't talk to people in person, I still keep in touch with them. I try to call my friends and cousins every day. My brothers set up an online gaming time on the Nintendo Switch with their friends so they can play Mario Kart together. My parents play board games at night with their friends.
Though this may be scary, I try to look on the bright side of things. I know that this pandemic won't last forever and that everything will be okay.
From Simran A., age 6, in Detroit, Michigan:

From Holly H., age 9, in Brooklyn, New York:
The coronavirus stopped me from being with my friends, going to school, and going on vacations, but it didn’t stop me from having fun. I was quite sad when I learned soccer was canceled. So I made solutions for my problems: I took some walks with my dad and I practiced a little soccer outside. Even though the amount of people who had it kept increasing, I didn't think there was something to be really worried about. 
The only thing I was slightly worried about was people in my family who were at high risk, like some of my relatives. Also, something I’ve been looking forward to is seeing my cousins in Washington, D.C., and I don’t even know if that’s for sure gonna happen yet. 
These days, I’ve been video calling my friends, drawing, doing a bit of work, and watching movies. But I get a bit of fresh air every week. The days are no longer the same as they were. This one virus can change a lot of things. 
But there’s also some good things about staying home. Sometimes, you don’t have to wake up so early and you get to be comfortable at your own house all day. If you have a lot of food and medical supplies, think about how lucky you are to be well prepared. Also if you have games you can play or puzzles, then you won’t be bored with nothing to do. 
Still, this new virus can be pretty scary. So if you’re someone who’s easily worried about it, my advice is to talk to someone you know really well about how you feel. Sometimes they can help reassure you.

The coronavirus  is affecting people all over the world. In the face of this global challenge, governments are working to stop the spread of the virus. People are doing their part to support health-care workers and lift spirits. Here, TIME for Kids looks at efforts in four of the countries hit hardest. These actions show us the power of kindness and cooperation.
China

No country has taken more-extreme steps to stop the spread of the coronavirus than China. The outbreak began in the city of Wuhan. That was in December. After nearly 11 weeks, China ended its lockdown in Wuhan on April 8.
Chinese billionaire Jack Ma has been doing his part to help others. He has sent supplies to people in Iran, Italy, Japan, and other countries. In March, he donated 500,000 test kits and a million masks to the U.S. “Speedy and accurate testing and  personal protective equipment for medical professionals are most effective in preventing the spread of the virus,” Ma said in a statement.
United States

The U.S. has the world’s highest number of confirmed coronavirus cases. At press time, it had nearly 600,000.
This could push the health-care system past its limits. In New York, thousands of retired doctors and nurses have stepped up to volunteer.
The federal government is also taking steps. In March, Congress passed a $2 trillion bill. The bill will help people who are out of work.
Ordinary people are helping, too. They’re delivering food to the elderly and giving thanks to medical workers. “You are extraordinary,” reads a message in chalk outside a hospital in New Orleans, Louisiana.
Italy

Until mid-April, Italy had had more deaths from COVID-19 than any other country. It has one of the largest percentages of people age 65 or older. Older people with the virus are at high risk.
On March 9, the Italian government declared a nationwide lockdown. The spread of the disease has slowed since then. Now Italy is testing more people for the virus. This makes it easier for health officials to decide who should be .
People are following orders to stay home. To cheer them up, musicians have been performing from balconies. They fill Italy’s empty streets with sound. Videos appear on social media. One post reads: “Italians . . . always making the best of the worst. How can you not love them!”
Spain

Spain ranks second in COVID-19 cases, behind the U.S. Data from April 13 showed about 170,000 infections there altogether. Many of the people infected were doctors and nurses. Like other countries, Spain did not have enough equipment to safely treat patients.
On March 14, Spain’s government told people to stay home. People have been leaning out their windows at night. They clap for health-care workers. Twitter user Carlos DelclÓs posted this message: “You are heroes. You are what  looks like, and I hope that solidarity is what’s most contagious these days.”

586,586,Easter Storms,"{'United States', 'Weather'}","
Severe weather swept through the southern United States, beginning on Easter Sunday, April 12. Tornadoes and thunderstorms hit Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas, and other states.
The storms caused flooding and mudslides. At least 33 people were killed. Hundreds of homes were damaged. Electricity was out for more than a million people.
“Power lines are down, trees are all over the place. It’s hard to get from one place to the other because the roads are blocked,” T.C. Smalls says. He’s the sheriff in Hampton County, South Carolina.
People are practicing social distancing to slow the spread of COVID-19. This made it hard for them to take shelter from the storms. In Alabama, Governor Kay Ivey temporarily lifted a shelter-in-place order. People in storm shelters in Mississippi were asked to wear masks, use hand sanitizer, and stay six feet apart.
Stop and Think! Who was affected by the severe weather described in this article? Why should people read about weather events even if they’re not from an affected area?

587,587,Vaccines in Progress,"{'World', 'Health'}","
Scientists all over the world are working to develop a vaccine. The vaccine’s purpose is to protect people from COVID-19. There are 70 vaccines in development globally. This was announced by the World Health Organization on April 11. Researchers in China are making progress. They have already tested their vaccine on people. So have some drugmakers in the United States.
“The good thing is we’ve got a bunch of candidates,” or possibilities, for vaccines, Dr. Anthony Fauci said in a podcast. Fauci is the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
But people will have to wait a while. Even if the early stages of testing are successful, it can take more than a year before a vaccine is widely available.

589,589,Learning at Home,"{'Culture', 'United States'}","
Students all over the world have been learning from home because of the coronavirus pandemic. More than 90% of students worldwide have been affected by school closures. That’s according to the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization.
Teachers and students are getting used to the sudden change. Most learning is taking place online in  classrooms. But some students don’t have access to computers and tablets or good Wi-Fi.
Educators say the pandemic has highlighted the “digital divide.” That’s the split between those who have access to the Internet and those who do not.
“It’s been impacting students all across the country,” Sonja Santelises told TIME for Kids. She’s the CEO of Baltimore City Public Schools, in Maryland. “In a time of crisis,” she says, “that divide is clearer and it’s .”
Coming Together
School districts across the United States are finding ways to overcome the digital divide. In Baltimore, kids can now watch lessons on cable TV. In Tucson, Arizona, school buses with Wi-Fi have been sent to neighborhoods where people have limited Internet access. And in Chicago, Illinois, more than 100,000 laptops and tablets were given to students who needed them.
Teachers are getting creative too. In Madison, South Dakota, a sixth-grade teacher set up a whiteboard outside a student’s front door. He gave her a math lesson from a safe distance. “It’s been a very old-fashioned and very personalized communication with the students,” Lora Davenport says. She’s a second-grade teacher in University City, Missouri.
Santelises says this is just what kids need right now. “The biggest challenge . . . has been the need to connect and be part of the school community.”
Students are stepping up and helping each other too. University City fifth grader London Trussel has advice for them. “Trust the process,” she says. “Just be patient and wait, and then we’ll all go back to school.”

Podcasts are a great way to stay connected to the world. And they’re excellent for kids who learn best by listening to information. Here are three of our favorite podcasts right now.
Do It Yourself

Want to stay busy while you’re socially distancing? The Kids Are All . . . Home is a new podcast from Pineapple Street Studios created by kids stuck at home because COVID-19.
Here’s how it works. Come up with an idea for a podcast. (So far, episodes have included everything from cooking demonstrations to musical numbers.) Record your podcast and send it in. Producers might include it in an episode.
Producer Eric Mennel says podcasting is the perfect boredom buster. “It’s an easy way to be super creative and weird,” he says.
A New Way to Get TFK

There’s a new way to connect with TIME for Kids: a podcast. The first episode is called “Time for Kids Explains: Pandemics.” In it, listeners learn about the new coronavirus and pandemics of the past.
To create the series, TFK teamed up with the podcast pros at Pinna. The premiere features TFK Kid Reporters Eshaan Mani and Alexis Bumah. “We had a ton of fun,” Eshaan says. “The recording process was full of laughs.”
The first episode is out now. Look for more TFK and Pinna podcasts this fall.
Ask Away!

But Why: A Podcast for Curious Kids answers questions from real kids. These range from “Are jellyfish made of jelly?” to “Who makes the laws?”
The show is hosted by Jane Lindholm for Vermont Public Radio. She says the podcast has received questions from kids in all 50 states and more than 50 countries.
Lindholm also says it’s important for kids to always stay curious. “Sometimes, as you get older, you start to think that your questions seem silly,” she told TFK. “But some of the most interesting discoveries have been made by people who never stop asking questions.”

We asked our team of TFK Kid Reporters for their perspective on the coronavirus pandemic. Here, TFK Kid Reporter Nora Wilson-Hartgrove, from Durham, North Carolina, shares her thoughts.
I live in a hospitality house, where people used to come and stay for a while or have something to eat. My family’s friend Sammie, who almost seems like an uncle to me, would stop by to heat up food, say hello, and joke around. Because of COVID-19, Sammie can’t drop by anymore. We had to put up a sign to let people know we can’t have any visitors.
I feel like I’ve lost my extended family, but I still have my mom, dad, siblings, and other housemates. I’m excited about the future but I’m also afraid. I worry about the possibility that someone in my house will get the disease and it will spread among all of us. But I’m excited when I think about the end of quarantine and the chance to go back to our old lives.
I really miss school, play dates, and public gatherings. But a couple of friends and I have found a way to meet on the corner in our neighborhood and talk in person. We set a time, bring chairs to the sidewalk, and sit six feet apart to catch up with one another.

596,596,Penguin Census,"{'Environment', 'Animals'}","
SNOW ISLAND, Antarctica—Click. Click click click. Click. Steve Forrest is a biologist. He’s standing at the top of a cliff. It’s on an island off the coast of the Antarctic . Below him are several hundred penguins and their chicks. Forrest’s job is to count every one of them with the metal clicker in his hand. It’s not easy. It’s snowing. The wind is howling. And the fluffy gray chicks won’t stay still.

Forrest has been coming to Antarctica every January for six years. He’s helping count the area’s chinstrap penguins. It’s part of a global penguin . This will help researchers better understand the Antarctic environment.
Ocean Life
There used to be lots of chinstraps in Antarctica. But their numbers are declining. Why? “All the evidence we have points to  as being responsible,” Heather J. Lynch says. She designed the survey. Census team member Noah Strycker adds, “We know [climate change] is hitting the Antarctic Peninsula harder than practically anywhere else in the world.”

Scientists suspect that warming waters affect krill, the tiny creatures that chinstraps eat. This is bad for the ocean . Whales eat krill. So do small fish that larger fish depend on. But krill are hard to study. So researchers focus on penguins. They’re easier to track. They return to the same spot each year to lay eggs. If chinstraps aren’t doing well, krill probably aren’t either. “Penguins give us an idea about what is going on in the ocean around us,” Forrest says.
That doesn’t mean counting penguins is easy. Chinstraps nest on rocky slopes to protect their eggs from . Sometimes, scientists use binoculars to count the birds from a distance. Other times, the census requires them to brave freezing water in inflatable boats. “It’s miserable, it’s cold, but we love it,” Forrest says. “We get to go places where few people have ever set foot.”

Chinstraps are great climbers. So scientists must be too. And penguins aren’t always clean. Their nesting grounds are coated in guano, or droppings, so these places are slippery and smelly.
Drone Assistance
This year, Forrest’s research team got help from robotics engineers from Northeastern University. That’s in Boston, Massachusetts. The engineers fly a drone over a colony in order to take pictures. The team will use those photos to record the colony’s location and size. It will also use them to teach computers how to recognize penguin nests. One day, computers could count penguins.

Counting penguins is important, Forrest says. The more we learn, the more we know about krill and the ocean animals that depend on them. “What’s happening in the Antarctic is happening everywhere,” he says. “When we understand it, we can start fixing it.”

597,597,Change in the Air,"{'Environment', 'World'}","
Cities and countries around the world are asking people to stay home to slow the spread of COVID-19. Fewer cars are on the road. Fewer planes are in the sky. Many businesses and factories are closed. So it’s no surprise that air pollution levels have dropped.
Places known for high levels of pollution have seen clear skies. Satellite images show less nitrogen dioxide over China, Italy, South Korea, and other countries affected by COVID-19. Nitrogen dioxide is a gas. It’s released by factories and cars. It’s a source of pollution. It can worsen health problems, such as asthma.
A drop in air pollution is welcome. But experts warn that it won’t last. Pollution levels will rise again when people get back to their normal lives. This has proven true in China, says Lauri Myllyvirta. He works for the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air. “Average pollution levels [in China] plummeted in February,” he said in a Twitter post. But the drop was temporary. Pollution returned to its usual levels by the end of March, after many lockdowns in China ended.
Gernot Wagner works at New York University. He says people need to find lasting solutions to air pollution. “The answer to pollution isn’t to stop all activity,” Wagner writes in TIME. “It’s to find ways to live our lives that don’t harm the Earth.”

598,598,Rising Water,"{'Environment', 'Technology'}","
If nothing is done to stop rising sea levels, the homes of 200 million people could be underwater by the year 2100. That’s according to a study in the scientific magazine Nature Communications. The study was published in October.
Climate change is melting glaciers and ice sheets. So sea levels are rising. Higher sea levels flood coastlines. If steps aren’t taken to protect cities and towns, people could be forced to move.
One European country is especially  to flooding: the Netherlands. More than a quarter of the country already sits below sea level. But the Netherlands has developed strategies for dealing with water. For that reason, many experts believe the country is well- to deal with rising seas. Could other nations use the Netherlands’ techniques?

Water Problems
In the region that is now the Netherlands, people have been inventing ways to keep out water for at least 900 years. “Taking care of water is taking care of ourselves,” says Henk Ovink. He works on water issues for the Dutch government.
Some techniques are high-tech. For example, the Maeslantkering is a huge storm-surge barrier. It protects the city of Rotterdam. It’s controlled by a supercomputer. Other methods look to nature for inspiration.

The DakAkker is a farm on top of an office building. The building’s roof holds rainwater to prevent runoff. Another example is the Floating Farm. Designers made room for farming in a waterlogged city. They came up with a farm that floats in Rotterdam’s waterways. Some 30 dairy cows live there.
Ovink often helps countries solve their water problems. “It’s not that our solutions are the best,” he says. “But your country’s solutions can be inspired by us and by nature.""

599,599,Should Cars be Banned in Cities?,"{'Debate', 'Opinion'}","
How do you travel around your town or city? Some people walk, ride a bike, or use public transportation. But most people get around by car. This might be convenient, but having too many cars on the road causes problems. Heavy traffic is a safety hazard. And it pollutes the air.
To address these issues, some cities have restricted the use of automobiles. In 2018, the mayor of Paris, France, declared that most of the city center would be car-free on the first Sunday of every month. A year later, New York City banned car traffic from one of its busiest crosstown streets. Should more cities ban cars? Here, four TIME for Kids readers share their opinion.
YES!

Suvir Leekha Talamas, 12
Roselle, Illinois
Cars are used every day, but most of us tend to ignore their disadvantages. They burn fossil fuels. This creates air pollution. There is also light pollution, which can affect the health of animals, plants, and people. Our reliance on cars prevents us from exercising and makes us lazier. Rather than walking to places nearby, we drive or take car services, like Uber. I’m not totally against cars, but it’s best to limit our use of them.
NO!

Juliet Simon, 10
Santa Monica, California
Just as people have become attached to screens, they’ve become attached to cars. You can’t tell an entire community to completely stop using cars. That would make people want to use them even more. Instead, I believe that we should limit people’s use of cars. We should expand and encourage the use of public transportation systems and introduce solar power to these systems.
YES!

Andres Gonzalez, 11
Miami, Florida
I believe cities should be car-free because air pollution is destroying our Earth. Cars are powered by gasoline, and the vapors that gas gives off contribute to this pollution. Some people overuse cars. They drive when their destination is only a block away. We can use different forms of transportation instead, such as bicycles and buses.
NO!

Lena Aloise, 10
Harvard, Massachusetts
Cars should not be banned in cities. Many people have a long commute to work each day. Banning cars would make it much more difficult for them to get to work. There are better ways to protect our environment. Car companies can continue to manufacture electric cars, which are more eco-friendly. That way, we can protect the environment without losing our independence.

601,601,Building Green,"{'Environment', 'World'}","
Have you ever noticed a problem that you couldn’t figure out how to fix? Dr. Aboubacar Kampo has. He was living in Côte d’Ivoire, a country in Africa, where plastic is a major environmental issue. Côte d’Ivoire’s biggest city, Abidjan, creates more than 300 tons of plastic trash a day, and only about 5% of it is recycled. “How can we transform plastic into something useful?” Kampo wondered.
Kampo works for UNICEF, the United Nations Children’s Fund. He asked his friends for help. “We had a competition over a weekend to figure out what could be done,” he told TIME for Kids. “We googled, looked for research, and then I stumbled across a company in Colombia.”

Colombia is a country in South America. Plastic pollution is a problem there, too. Conceptos Plásticos is the Colombian company that Kampo found online. It recycles plastic and turns it into big, Lego-like bricks. It uses them to build schools and homes for communities in need.
Kampo went to Colombia to learn about Conceptos Plásticos. He toured schools that were built with its bricks. He went to its factory. Isabel Cristina Gamez is a cofounder and the CEO of Conceptos Plásticos. She says, “Once Dr. Kampo understood the impact, he said, ‘We need to find a way to get you to Côte d’Ivoire.’ From that moment on, we worked together.” “Conceptos Plásticos gave us a solution,” Kampo says. He thought the company could help with more than just the plastic problem. It could also improve children’s  to education.

Making Room
According to UNICEF, more than 1½ million children in Côte d’Ivoire don’t go to school. One reason is that there aren’t enough classrooms. For kids who do go to school, classrooms are often severely overcrowded. UNICEF communications chief Sophie Chavanel says, “I stepped into a classroom and all these 3- and 4-year-olds were sitting on the floor. There wasn’t room to move around.”
In 2018, UNICEF built its first classrooms of recycled plastic in Abidjan, using bricks made in Colombia by Conceptos Plásticos.
Chavanel says that when a new room opened, the children gathered in the middle, “really tight, the same way they had before. The teacher said, ‘No! Now we have a big classroom. You can move! You can dance!’ Straight away, it made a difference in the quality of education.”
Tirangue Doumbia was the teacher that day. “People couldn’t believe that the classrooms were made of plastic,” she says. When TFK spoke with her, in March, Côte d’Ivoire schools had just closed because of the coronavirus pandemic.

Building the Future
At press time, UNICEF had built 27 classrooms in Côte d’Ivoire. It plans to have 528 built by the end of 2021. The new Conceptos Plásticos factory in Abidjan will soon be producing bricks from trash collected locally. The environmental impact is huge. UNICEF says it takes about five and a half tons of plastic to build a classroom. Construction takes just a few weeks.

How have students responded to the project? “Kids love it,” Kampo says. “When we build a classroom, we build it with the community. The kids get to see how it’s built.” Unlike  construction, no cement is needed, he adds. “It’s just a hammer and those bricks.”

The Amazon rain forest is home to millions of plant and animal species. But deforestation is a rising theat, Daniel Nepstad tells TIME for Kids. Last year, wildfires tore through the Amazon. At the time, “you could really imagine that ‘Boy, we could lose this thing,’” he says.

Take a look at some of the species that Nepstad and other ecologists are working to protect.

TOWERING TREES The seedpods of a Brazil-nut tree are the size of a baseball. When ripe, they drop to the ground. A rodent called an agouti cracks them open with its teeth to get the nut. The animals bury the nuts for later. New trees grow. “These are iconic trees, illegal to cut,” Nepstad says.

FOREST GARDENERS Leaf-cutter ants harvest leaves. They bury them in big underground chambers full of fungus. This is good for the soil. According to Nepstad, “It’s a tiny animal that has an over-the-top influence on how the forest grows.”

BIG FISH The pirarucu (pee-ra-roo-koo) is a giant, ancient fish. It can weigh 300 pounds. “It’s fascinating because it needs to breathe,” Nepstad says. People catch the pirarucu when it comes up for air. The fish is strong. It can tip a canoe over as it lashes about.

SHY CREATURE The sloth lives high up in the trees. Its fur acts as camouflage. It protects the sloth from predators. About once a week, sloths come down to the forest floor. “They’re concerned about being found,” Nepstad says.

FAVORITE FRUIT The cacao (ka-kow) plant is native to the Amazon. It’s the source of chocolate. Its seeds have long been used as medicine, Nepstad says. Some farmers are planting cacao in the Amazon. They want to bring back native plants to deforested areas.

PLAYFUL IN PINK The Amazon river dolphin lives in the waters that flow through the rain forest. It’s believed that the male dolphin’s color protects it from predators by helping it blend in with the muddy water.  The pink color might come from scars from playing rough with other dolphins.

604,604,City of Trees,"{'World', 'Earth Science'}","
Karachi, Pakistan, is one of the hottest cities on Earth. In June 2015, more than 1,000 people died there during a heat wave. “It was a terrible time,” Shahzad Qureshi told TIME for Kids. “We needed to do something about it.”
After the heat wave, Qureshi took action. He started Urban Forest. The group plants  trees in cities in Pakistan. 
Trees help cool the air by providing shade and releasing moisture through their leaves. Trees can help lower summer temperatures in cities by 2° to 9°F. That’s according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
For its first project, Urban Forest planted about 1,300 trees in a park in Karachi. The group uses a  that helps them grow quickly. In just three years, the trees were 30 feet tall. Qureshi hopes that one day, this park will become a forest of 50,000 trees. 

Keeping Things Cool
Since 2015, Qureshi and his team have helped cool the air by planting 14 urban forests in Pakistan. Twelve are in Karachi. The trees also provide a habitat for a variety of animals and food for the community. And they create a shady spot where people can kick back and relax. 
In 2017, Qureshi helped plant an urban forest at Karachi Grammar School. First, he met with students there. He taught them about how trees help the environment. Then the students pitched in. They helped plant  in the schoolyard. 
“They were excited about the project,” Muneeza Shaikhali says. She’s a headmistress at Karachi Grammar School. “They themselves had been experiencing the high temperatures in the summer months.”
The trees attract birds and colorful butterflies. Students go outside during science class to study the forest. “It’s like a library of native trees in front of the kids,” Qureshi says. “They can identify the native species, bugs, and insects that are around. It’s a beautiful thing to see.”

605,605,8 Questions for the Irwins,"{'Environment', 'People'}","
Bindi and Robert Irwin are the children of conservationist and Australia Zoo personality Steve Irwin. Their reality-TV show, Crikey! It’s the Irwins, teaches people to care about wildlife. They spoke with TFK Kid Reporter Priscilla L. Ho.
1. What’s it like to run Australia Zoo?
Robert: We live and work at the zoo. There are about 1,200 different kinds of animals there. Our dad and our mom, Terri, wanted the zoo to be a place where animals are given the best life possible.
2. Tell us about your charity, Wildlife Warriors.
Bindi: Wildlife Warriors helps conservation on a global scale. We work with scientists to study how we can protect wildlife. We also have  all over Australia. There, animals are protected in their natural habitat.
3. Have you helped animals affected by the recent bushfires in Australia?
Bindi: We’ve taken in flying foxes at the zoo’s wildlife hospital. The mothers flew away from the fires. Their babies weren’t able to follow. We’re treating the babies until they are old enough to go back into the wild.
4. What animal needs the most attention to be saved from extinction?
Robert: Every animal is important. You need insects to take care of plants, and you need birds and smaller mammals, and big predators, like crocodiles and bears. Lose any one of them, and their  starts to fall apart.
5. Your show, Crikey! It’s the Irwins, launched in 2018. What do you hope the show achieves?
Bindi: We want the show to make people feel good. But we want viewers to learn something, too. We hope they watch it and think, “Gosh, that’s really important. We’ve got to make a difference for these animals.”
6. How did you balance school with your work at the zoo and filming the TV show?
Bindi: We did online classes. That allowed us to do all our traveling and work at the zoo. Our mom and dad instilled a passion for adventure and learning every day.
7. Which wild place would you most like to visit?
Robert: I would like to see polar bears in the wild. Bindi: I want to go to the Himalayas and see the red pandas.
8. How can kids protect the world’s wildlife?
Robert: Simple things make a big difference. You can help clean up a park or beach, or set out a birdbath. And it’s important to learn all you can about conservation. Then start a conversation with your peers, your family, and your teachers.

606,606,Kids Report on COVID-19: Jack in Georgia,"{'People', 'Community'}","
We asked our team of TFK Kid Reporters for their perspective on the coronavirus pandemic. Here, TFK Kid Reporter Jack Doane, from Rex, Georgia, shares his thoughts.
The coronavirus has single-handedly shut down everything. For me, that means my school band trip to Disney World has to be canceled, I can’t connect with my friends as often, and I can’t attend my horse-riding lessons. I worry about my grandmother every day, because her lungs are weak already.
My school has started distance learning, so instead of going to the bus stop in the morning, I make the “dangerous” journey across the hall to my office. I do all my schoolwork from home, and attend classes through an online video-chatting platform. I still have homework, sadly. I also bring my Chihuahua, Peanut, to class every once in a while. He sits patiently on my lap as my teacher lectures. 
I have a plethora of time with the reduced school hours, and I sometimes struggle to find things to do. I often walk Peanut with my mother and grandmother. Most of the time, I just tear up the tires on my bike while flying down hills as fast as possible. I’m lucky to be able to ride my bike where I live without having to worry too much about social distancing. I also read, play lots of video games, and text my friends when I’m not doing anything else. 
Hopefully, life will return to normal soon. Until then, I’m ready to play my part in stopping the spread of the virus.

609,609,Kids Report on COVID-19: Alexis from Ohio,"{'People', 'Community'}","
We asked our team of TFK Kid Reporters for their perspective on the coronavirus pandemic. Here, TFK Kid Reporter Alexis Bumah, from Dayton, Ohio, shares her experience.
There was a rapid change of events in my life starting about three weeks ago. On Wednesday, March 11, my teachers said we might not have school the following week due to the coronavirus. On Thursday, March 12, we were told not to report to school the next day. This was to give our teachers time to prepare for the possibility of conducting school online. Later that day, Ohio governor Mike DeWine announced that all schools in the state would be closed for three weeks. The idea of not having to wake up early was exciting. But the thought of so many people getting sick is scary.
After doing some research, I learned that the term coronavirus refers to a large family of viruses. I also learned that on February 11, the World Health Organization announced an official name for the disease caused by the new coronavirus: COVID-19. The name for this disease was created by using its name and year. In COVID-19, CO stands for corona. VI stands for virus. D stands for disease. And it was discovered in humans in 2019.
My career goal is to become a medical research scientist. This virus has me thinking about how vaccines are developed and the time it takes for a vaccine, once developed, to go from the lab to pharmacies and into the hands of people in need. If there were treatment options now, I might still be going to New York, which my mom and I planned to visit for my 13th birthday, during my spring break. The thought of postponing the trip made me edgy. But that was exactly what we had to do. As the saying goes, when life gives you lemons, make lemonade.
I’m now taking online classes with my classmates. I can complete my online assignments in half the time I usually spend during a typical school day. With the extra time, I can work on some of my favorite pastimes: reading, writing, and practicing sports.
I know social distancing is causing a lot of us to become bored and uneasy. My advice to preteens and teens is to think outside the box. Try working on a DIY project, or creating a board game. And last but not least, insist that your parents allow you to teach them how to “hit the woah” (it’s a trending dance move). My new motto? When life gives you a virus, create a vaccine!

We asked our team of TFK Kid Reporters for their perspective on the coronavirus pandemic. Here, TFK Kid Reporter Raunak Singh, from Fair Lawn, New Jersey, shares his thoughts.
COVID-19 is caused by an infectious coronavirus. Many people have already gotten sick. The word corona, translated from Latin, means crown. If we don’t work together to fight its spread, the virus will be “crowned” the victor. But you can help us win! 
Take steps like washing your hands well. And the less you travel, the safer the world will be. As you stay at home, think of it as care-for-your-family time. 
Here are some good activities to try: 
Play with your pets. Go for a walk with your family. Play ball with a sibling. Ride your bike in your neighborhood. Read a book. Call or FaceTime a friend. Learn on the Internet. Play a classic board game. Draw. Relax. 
Have you seen people helping each other in your neighborhood? Someone picking up someone else’s groceries? Or people giving things to those who aren’t able to find them at the store? A few days ago, as I was going to check the mail, one of my mom’s friends called me. She told me that if my family was running out of any supplies, she’d be happy to lend some to us. I said we had enough supplies, but I was touched.
That’s the good side of this pandemic: People are becoming more sympathetic to each other. When my mom was picking up supplies at our local ShopRite, we saw a man helping an elderly woman carry her bags. And I read in the news that two young cellists, ages 7 and 9, played a short concert—at a safe distance—for their 78-year-old neighbor. 
So try to be kind in your community. If we work together, maintain safe practices, and keep ourselves busy at home, we can fight this little microbe!

The 2020 Summer Olympic Games, in Tokyo, Japan, will be postponed for about a year. This is because of the coronavirus pandemic.
That announcement was made by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) on Tuesday, March 24. The IOC said the games will be held “not later than summer 2021” but will still be called the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020. The IOC and Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, made the decision “to safeguard the health of the athletes, everybody involved in the Olympic Games, and the international community,” an IOC statement said.
The Summer Olympics were set to run from July 24 through August 9. They join a long list of major sporting events put off or canceled due to the risks from COVID-19. For months, athletes and health officials have pressed the IOC to delay the games.
The IOC said that keeping the Olympic flame burning until 2021 could help the world heal from the pandemic. “The leaders agreed that the Olympic Games in Tokyo could stand as a beacon of hope . . . during these troubled times,” it said.
Never before have the Olympic Games been postponed. But they have been canceled, in 1916, 1940, and 1944—during World War I and World War II.

613,613,Kids Report on COVID-19: Henry in Massachusetts,"{'People', 'Community'}","
We asked our team of TFK Kid Reporters for their perspective on the coronavirus pandemic. Here, TFK Kid Reporter Henry Carroll, from Boston, Massachusetts, shares his thoughts on what kids can do to help.
Over the New Year’s holiday, our close family friends came skiing with us. As a present, they brought me a board game called Pandemic. At the time, I didn’t know how appropriate for 2020 this game would be.
With most board games, players play against each other. But in Pandemic, all players win or lose together as a single team. To win, you must work as a group and collaborate to cure four diseases. Everyone has a job and can contribute to the group’s success.
During a real pandemic, everyone also has a role to play. Different groups must work together to keep people from getting sick. Governments establish plans; health professionals care for sick people; scientists look for treatments and cures; the press makes sure people are aware of what’s happening. Even kids can help. 
Though kids might not always feel like they are important, they can help their family and their community in big ways. They can prevent the virus from spreading by practicing social distancing, good hand-washing, and not touching their faces. Kids can also do things to thank the adults who are working hard to fight the pandemic and provide essential services. My sister and I did this. I wrote a letter to scientists at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and my sister wrote a letter to doctors working in a hospital emergency room. We thanked them for trying to make things better. Hopefully, our letters will make them feel happy.
Kids can also participate by helping their family. When school is canceled, kids can help around the house and entertain themselves if their parents need to work from home. My sisters and I have had fun doing art with glitter dots, making our own books, building pillow forts, and, of course, playing Pandemic. Kids who have younger siblings, can entertain them by reading to them or playing with them. But the most important thing kids can do to help both their family and their community is to be supportive and understanding of other people.
This is a hard time for everyone, but it can be empowering for kids to realize they can help. Whether it’s in the game Pandemic or in real life, everyone has an important role. Working together is how you win.

614,614,Comic Craze!,"{'Business', 'Books'}","
When Raina Telgemeier was a kid in the 1980s, she fell in love with comics. “They were the perfect combination of all the things I liked: characters and stories and humor and artwork,” she told TIME for Kids.
But she had a problem: a shortage of reading material. Two types of comics were widely available to kids. There were comic books about superheroes. But those weren’t her thing. She wanted comics that told stories she could relate to as an ordinary kid. And there were newspaper comic strips. Telgemeier loved some of them, especially Calvin and Hobbes. But she wanted more.
At around 10, she started drawing her own comics. Twenty-three years later, she published Smile. It’s about Telgemeier’s middle school experiences with braces and dental surgery.
Before Smile was published, in 2010, it wasn’t clear the book would succeed. People in the publishing industry had doubts. They figured kids wouldn’t enjoy a graphic novel about an average girl.
They were wrong. Smile became a Number 1 best-seller. Since then, Telgemeier has published several more popular graphic novels. There are more than 18 million copies of her books in print. Telgemeier’s success has made a big . Industry experts say she paved the way for many more graphic novels for kids.

Then and Now
Comics have been around since at least the 19th century. Traditional comic books are short. Often, they’re about adventure or superheroes. “Comics have this history . . . of either being very funny and silly or having a lot of punching of things,” Gina Gagliano says. She works on graphic novels at Random House. That’s a publishing company.
Today’s graphic novels are different. Authors use comics to tell a book-length story. It can be any . It can be realistic.
In 2018, sales of graphic novels for kids and teens jumped by more than 50%. Compare that to sales of printed books across all categories. They increased by about 1%.
Real Reading
As sales boom, attitudes about comics are changing. This year, New Kid became the first graphic novel to win the Newbery Medal. That’s a  award in children’s literature.
New Kid author Jerry Craft says that when he was a kid, he read mainly comics. He knew some adults didn’t approve. “In certain schools, if they saw you reading a comic, they would  it, because they thought it was rotting your brain,” he says. “They didn’t realize the amount of imagination and storytelling and vocabulary in those comics.”
New Kid’s Newbery shows what many kids already understood: Graphic novels are real books. “It’s a victory for all graphic novels,” Craft says.

615,615,8 Questions for Jerry Craft,"{'Business', 'Books'}","
Jerry Craft is the author of New Kid. It’s a graphic novel about an African-American boy who feels out of place in his mostly white school. In 2019, New Kid became the first graphic novel to win the Newbery Medal, one of the most prestigious awards in children’s literature. Craft spoke with TFK’s Shay Maunz about his career, the Newbery Medal, and the upcoming sequel to New Kid.
What did you read as a kid?
I only read Marvel comics. There was no such thing for me as enjoyable book-reading. That was always a chore. In school, I felt like all the books that featured kids of color were about slavery or civil rights. And all the other books were just so far from my life. I couldn’t relate to them at all.
What did you like about comic books?
It was definitely the pictures. But also, take someone like Spider-Man. I felt like I had a lot in common with Peter Parker, who is Spider-Man. At least Peter Parker was a teenager. And even though he had these superpowers, he was kind of nerdy and he had to keep his powers a secret. I related more to him than any literary characters I had ever met.
Did adults approve of your comic-book habit?
Neither of my parents ever belittled it. I know in certain schools, if they saw you reading a comic, they would confiscate it, because they thought it was rotting your brain. They didn't realize the amount of imagination and storytelling and vocabulary in those comics. With Marvel comics, for example, every title had an adjective that was a really cool word: The Spectacular Spiderman. Uncanny X-Men. The Macabre Man-Thing.
How did you start making your own comics?
I never considered myself a writer because I never considered myself a reader—how could you be one without the other? But I always loved to draw. And if I was going to draw comics, well, obviously I had to write a story to go with them. So I started making my own comic books. Then I started doing comic strips. Later I decided I wanted to do a book.
Why did you want to write a book?
One year, I went to the National Book Festival, in Washington, DC. That's where I met Raina Teglemeier [author of Guts]. She was up on stage, and I saw how her fans were just in heaven. I had never before seen a kid clutching a book like it was their favorite doll. When I was a kid, I never had a book that was so special to me that I wanted to hug it. I set out to make a book that kids of color could relate to like many kids relate to Raina’s books.
What does New Kid’s Newbery Medal win mean to you?
I can sum that up with a story that a woman wrote to me on Twitter. She said she was in a bookstore and a man came in with his son. The son said, “Hey, Dad, can I get a graphic novel?” And his dad said, “No, I’d rather you get a real book.” Then the bookstore worker says, “Did you know that a graphic novel just won the Newbery Medal?” To which the dad says, “Oh, in that case, get whatever you want.” To me, that sums it up. If I can be so bold as to say it: It’s a victory for all graphic novels.
Do you think graphic novels are more respected now than when you were young?
Absolutely. Now there are so many great librarians and teachers who realize that reading is reading. It doesn’t matter if it’s a prose book or a graphic novel or a book of poetry.
Are you working on a new book?
I am. It’s a sequel to New Kid. I’m drawing right now as we’re talking [on the phone]. Graphic novels are time-consuming. I can’t just say, “His teacher came to the door.” I have to think about what kind of shoes the teacher wears, her blouse, how her hair looks, all of that. But it’s definitely worth it. I wouldn’t change a thing—except if I could clone myself so one of me could be working on this book 24/7 and the other one could be answering emails. That would be ideal. But until that happens, I’m working on it every moment I can. It comes out in October.

616,616,Social Distancing,"{'People', 'Health'}","
To limit the spread of COVID-19, health experts say people should practice social distancing. But what does that really mean?
Social distancing means “avoiding  gatherings” and “maintaining distance.” That’s according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Even people who are six feet apart from one another can spread the virus. They can do so through droplets from coughs and sneezes. Social distancing limits the chances of that.
Dr. Susy Hota is an infectious-disease specialist. She’s at the University of Toronto, in Canada. “Social distancing is a very general term,” she says. “There are a bunch of different types of measures that can fall under it.” These include learning from home instead of at school and canceling playdates and sports events. 
Denise Rousseau works at Carnegie Mellon University. That’s in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. She says many people can’t stay home all the time, even during a disease outbreak. “People have lives that they need to continue to live,” Rousseau says. By keeping space between themselves and others, people “can reduce the likelihood that the virus can be ,” she says (see “Flattening the Curve,” below).
Hota and Rousseau know it can be hard to keep away from others sometimes, such as on public transportation. In these cases, social distancing means doing the best you can.
Stop and Think! Why is it important to hear from experts during an emergency? How does information from experts help limit the spread of misinformation?

617,617,Kids Report on COVID-19: Mira in Kansas,"{'People', 'Community'}","
We asked our team of TFK Kid Reporters for their perspective on the coronavirus pandemic. Here, TFK Kid Reporter Mira McInnes, from Leawood, Kansas, shares her experience.
For a while, the coronavirus didn’t seem like something I personally had to worry about. No one in the area where I live had tested positive for it yet, and almost all restaurants and stores were still open. Being a nervous person, I sometimes felt a lot of anxiety about it. But I felt it was very unlikely that my life would be dramatically impacted by the virus. 
Ever since my family vacationed in Florida last year, we planned to go to Mexico the following spring break. But on March 11, it was decided that we would not be going. Since I had been looking forward to the trip for almost a year, this was very disappointing. It was when I first really knew that the coronavirus wasn’t as distant of a concern as I thought. 
The number of coronavirus cases has been changing rapidly. As of March 17, there were 16 in Kansas. That number includes one death, a man who passed away in a nursing home. 
All schools in Kansas are now closed for the rest of the school year, following orders from the governor, Laura Kelly. In some respects, this is exciting, but it also means I won’t be able to see my friends for a long time. We will be doing some sort of online learning with our teachers, but plans for that haven’t been finalized yet. 
Until at least April 1, all bars, restaurants, libraries, and movie theaters here are closed. Some of the only places still open are hospitals, drive-throughs, and grocery stores. This means that most people, including my family, are staying at home all day. Having very little structure in the day can lead to boredom. So I’ve been doing a lot of reading and writing, working on my own short stories and novels. I’m also trying to finish the final season of Netflix’s Riverdale with my sister, and my family has been progressing through the Lord of the Rings movie trilogy. 
My advice for kids who are anxious or uncertain about the coronavirus is this: It is completely fine to feel this way! To make yourself feel better, ask one of your parents to take you around your home and show you all of the supplies you have. This will reassure you that you have everything you need. Talking to someone you trust can put your mind at ease.

Many schools have dress codes. They are meant to help students focus on learning. Some prevent boys from wearing their hair long. This bans styles such as afros and dreadlocks. Some ban braids, twists, and other styles associated with Black culture.
Jonathan’s story isn’t the only one of its kind. In January, Texas teen DeAndre Arnold was told he needed to cut his dreadlocks to go to his graduation. Twins Mya and Deanna Cook are from Massachusetts. In 2017, they were given detention at their school. The school said their hair extensions violated code.
Esi Eggleston Bracey sees these types of rules as hair . She helped start the CROWN Coalition. CROWN stands for Create a Respectful and Open World for Natural Hair.
Act Now
Tiffany took the issue up with the school board. After about six months, Jonathan’s school changed its code. The CROWN Coalition hopes to prevent other students from having to go through this process. That’s why it  the CROWN Act. The act seeks to prevent schools and workplaces from discriminating against black people for wearing their hair in “natural styles.”
Bracey wants kids to feel proud of their hair. “There have been far too many incidents of children being sent home, suspended, or expelled from school because of their textured hairstyles,” she says.
The CROWN Act has passed in five states. And there are efforts to pass it nationally. “I think it’s empowering,” Tiffany Brown says. “The CROWN Act is now saying ‘No longer will we be forced to not be who we are. And our hair is included.’”

The coronavirus continues to spread throughout the world. Keeping your distance from others during the  could slow the virus down. It could also save lives.
A simple chart tells us how. It shows two situations. One is what could happen if nothing were done to stop the spread of the virus. Many cases of the disease that it causes, COVID-19, would appear all at once. The other is what could happen if everyone followed health-safety guidelines. These include social distancing.
“There’s an opportunity here to take power over this virus,” Drew Harris told TIME for Kids. Harris is a researcher at Thomas Jefferson University, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He’s one of the creators of the chart.
Taking Control
Experts like Harris say it’s important to slow the spread of the coronavirus. They call this “flattening the curve.” The chart includes two curves. The red one has a steep peak. It represents a  of COVID-19 cases. This happens if no protective measures are taken. The blue curve has a flatter slope. This represents a slower rate of infection over a longer period of time.
And that’s the goal: to spread out infections over time. Then hospitals can care for patients before more people get sick. There will be beds and medical equipment for those who need them.
Harris offers a comparison: Imagine everyone in your family got the flu. You couldn’t care for one another. He says, “Wouldn’t it be better if everyone took turns getting the flu so there is always somebody healthy to care for others? That’s what we want to do in our society.”
To slow the spread of COVID-19, officials have closed some schools and businesses. Big events have been canceled. This may make people feel disconnected. But the chart shows that we’re not really alone. “We are connected in many more ways than just being near each other physically,” Harris says. “All of us, young and old, have a responsibility to take care of each other.”

Get ready to jam out with Trolls World Tour. It’s a sequel to the 2016 Trolls movie. The film follows troll friends Poppy and Branch as they make a big discovery: Theirs is not the world’s only troll tribe. Poppy and Branch learn that every tribe is dedicated to a different type of music—funk, country, techno, classical, pop, or rock. Rock troll King Thrash and his daughter, Queen Barb, want to destroy the other tribes and transform all trolls into rock zombies.
Ron Funches is the voice of Cooper, a four-legged troll. “Cooper is a member of the Snack Pack,” Funches told TIME for Kids. Its members, which include Poppy and Branch, are pop trolls.

622,622,Kids Report on COVID-19: Eshaan in Texas,"{'People', 'Community'}","
We asked our team of TFK Kid Reporters for their perspective on the coronavirus pandemic. Here, TFK Kid Reporter Eshaan Mani, from Houston, Texas, shares his thoughts.
“Coronavirus Declared a Pandemic, Says World Health Organization.” These words flashed across my TV. What started in a market in the city of Wuhan, China, had spiraled into one of the biggest health crises ever. I had been tracking COVID-19 since its early days. I never thought it would affect the United States. But things were starting to get very, very real. So real, in fact, that my family had to change our spring break plans five times. Finally, just days before COVID-19 hit the United States, we decided to take a staycation.
On March 4, the first case of COVID-19 was reported in Houston. More quickly surfaced—the count went from 1 to 3 to 9 to 15 to 30. On March 12, my school announced that all classes would be canceled until March 30. If classes are postponed further, we’re going to engage in online learning. 
Ever since spring break started, my family has been trying to maintain a normal routine. We’ve been washing our hands, keeping things around us sanitized, and not touching our faces. We go for a morning walk in a park close to home to catch some fresh air. At home, I’ve been watching several Netflix shows and the news. I spend time playing games and catching up with my friends and cousins online through video chat. My dad usually travels for work, but he’s been asked to work from home through April so I am enjoying quality time with him.
The in-person interviews I’d scheduled for the next few weeks have now become Zoom calls. It’s not the same as meeting with someone face to face, but these web calls work and they keep me busy. I recently interviewed and wrote about a kid entrepreneur in my hometown.
The wonderful thing about our society is that we help people out in times of need. The other day, I went shopping with my mom to stock up on supplies. While checking out, we talked with the cashier about how busy the store was. Suddenly, another customer dropped off bags full of groceries for the pleasantly surprised cashier. The cashier then explained to us that she had made a passing comment to that customer about her long hours and lack of time to buy essentials. By the time the store closed and she could shop for groceries, all the shelves were empty. So the customer asked her what items she needed and, without her knowledge, bought them to surprise her. The cashier told us that ""good people do exist in these tough times.""
My advice to kids (and adults!) is to stay safe and sanitized, make the most of your time with family, enjoy the outdoors, and know that “this too shall pass.” 
Kids, ask a parent or guardian if you can tell us about your experience during this time. If so, have them email us at tfkeditors@time.com. Your response might be featured on our website or in an upcoming issue.

623,623,Coronavirus Questions?,"{'People', 'Health'}","
The coronavirus  is a public health emergency. Coronaviruses are a group of viruses that can infect animals and people. Some cause mild illness, like the common cold, while others can lead to serious illness. The type causing the current pandemic is new to scientists.
The new coronavirus was first identified in China in December. On February 11, the illness was officially named COVID-19. It spread quickly around the world. Scientists and doctors from many countries are working together to stop the spread and find a cure. 
To answer kids’ questions about COVID-19, TIME for Kids writer Rebecca Mordechai spoke with Dr. Juan Dumois. He’s an infectious-diseases specialist at Johns Hopkins All Children’s Hospital, in Florida. Here’s what he had to say.
1. The coronavirus causes an illness called COVID-19. What are its symptoms?
Symptoms include fever, coughing, and shortness of breath.
2. What should I do if I have these symptoms?
If you’re sick, tell a trusted adult. Symptoms can be treated. It may take a few days to a week to feel better.
3. How does the virus spread?
If you’re near someone who coughs or sneezes, you can inhale the virus. If they cough or sneeze on a surface, you can pick up the virus by touching it. Avoid getting the virus by washing your hands.
4. How dangerous is the virus to kids?
Children seem to be much less affected than adults. If kids do get sick, they’re less likely to have severe symptoms.
5. What can I do to stay healthy?
Before touching your face, wash your hands for 20 seconds—that’s “Happy Birthday” two times—with soap and running water, or use hand sanitizer. There are also things you can do to strengthen your immune system. That helps the body fight off infections. Your immune system can be made stronger if you eat a healthy diet. Getting enough sleep is also important.
6. What should I do if I’m feeling anxious about COVID-19?
Don’t be shy about talking to a parent, a teacher, or to another trusted adult. Feeling out of control can also make you anxious. But you can have some control by following safety and health guidelines.
7. What are some common myths about the virus?
One myth is that wearing a mask is all you need to protect yourself from COVID-19. Washing your hands properly and frequently is more helpful.
8. What can schools do to protect students?
Schools should make hand sanitizer available. That’s really important. Hand sanitizer needs to be rubbed on both hands, and it should take at least 15 seconds to dry. Doorknobs and desks should also be wiped down at least once a day, or ideally after each class.

As the new coronavirus travels around the world, communities are taking steps to stop its spread.
The new virus was first found in China in December. Since then, the virus has spread quickly. It causes the disease COVID-19. By March 12, cases had been found in 116 countries. Nearly 130,000 people have tested positive for it.
Most people get only mildly sick from COVID-19. But more than 4,700 have died. Many were over the age of 80. COVID-19 can be serious for people who are elderly or who have medical conditions. But most people make a full recovery.
In China, the government has put strict rules in place to limit the disease’s spread. Nearly 60 million people have been told to stay home. This is called quarantine. This seems to be working. The number of new cases in China has been falling.
Italy is seeing the largest outbreak of COVID-19 outside China. On March 9, Italian officials banned most people from travel within Italy until at least April 3. They’ve told the country’s 60 million people to leave home only when necessary.
COVID-19 in the U.S.
In the United States, about 1,300 cases of COVID-19 are confirmed. On March 11, President Donald Trump announced major restrictions on travel Europe to the U.S. will be halted for 30 days. This is to fight the .
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says older adults and people with medical conditions should stay home and avoid crowds.
When a person tests positive for COVID-19, officials retrace his or her movements from before the diagnosis. They reach out to everyone who came in contact with the person. Those people are asked to go into quarantine for 14 days.
“Absolutely, we see a light at the end of the tunnel, but how quickly we get there depends on what countries do,” Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove says. She’s with the World Health Organization.
Scientists are racing to create a COVID-19 medicine and vaccine. According to U.S. health official Alex Azar, it could be 12 to 18 months before the vaccine’s ready.

625,625,Schools Respond,"{'Places', 'Health'}","
By March 12, almost 377 million students around the world were out of school because of COVID-19. That’s according to the United Nations (U.N.). Schools have closed due to health emergencies before. But the U.N. says the “global scale and speed” of the current closures are “unparalleled.”
So far, 46 countries have closed schools or announced plans to. Twenty-six, including China, Iran, and Italy, have closed all schools. These places have had severe outbreaks. China’s is the most severe. 
In the United States, schools and districts decide what actions to take. At press time, only a few had closed. Others are likely to follow. Many districts see closures as a last resort. Students may depend on schools for meals and after-school programs. 
“We would only consider closing any particular school for very specific reasons,” Bill de Blasio told the New York Times on March 9. He’s the mayor of New York City. Its school district is the country’s largest.
On March 11, Seattle public schools, in Washington State, said they would close. District superintendent Denise Juneau said it was a last resort but called the situation “unprecedented.”
Online Learning
Schools are turning to online learning so lessons can continue. Washington State’s Northshore School District closed schools on March 5, for up to 14 days. “We are simply trying to do our part to slow the spread of COVID-19,” Michelle Reid wrote in a letter to families. She’s the district superintendent. Learning will “transition from the classroom to the cloud,” she added. And if students need computers? Reid says the district will loan them.
In Pennsylvania’s Chester County, Malvern Preparatory School is open. But it’s training its staff to teach online. “We hope not to close school,” wrote Donald Reilly, head of the school, in a letter to students and staff. “However, we feel it is best to be prepared.”

626,626,A Look at the Economy,"{'The View', 'Health'}","
Because of COVID-19, people are being more careful. “They don’t want to gather in groups where they may be in contact with somebody who has the virus” that causes it, money expert Jean Chatzky told TIME for Kids. Many are staying home and limiting travel. Large public events have been canceled. And when people aren’t out spending money, businesses, employees, and the overall  suffer.
Businesses are also having trouble keeping items in stock. Products used in the United States are often made in China. But China has been hit hard by COVID-19, so many things are in limited supply. These include some food items and toys.
There are also shortages of health and cleaning products. As people stock up, some stores are running out of items such as hand sanitizer and disinfecting wipes. “These things are flying off the shelves,” Chatzky says.
Stock Market Trouble
Concern about COVID-19 and its impact on the economy is affecting the stock market. This is where people can buy parts of public companies. These parts are called stocks or shares. When a company does well, its stocks go up.  make money. When a company does poorly, the opposite happens. Because the COVID-19 outbreaks are hurting many businesses, stock prices are falling.
On March 9, the stock market lost more money than it had in one day since 2008. “Markets hate uncertainty,” Chatzky says. And unfortunately, no one knows how long the COVID-19 outbreaks will last or how widely the disease will spread. In a televised speech on March 11, President Donald Trump announced a number of actions the federal government would take to try to help the economy recover.
Chatzky says that it’s important for kids to know about COVID-19 and to understand how it’s affecting businesses and the economy. “The more you know,” she says, “the less likely you are to be afraid.”

627,627,Going Cashless,"{'Business', 'Places'}","
Picture this: You saved up your allowance. You finally have enough money to buy that toy or game you’ve been dreaming of. You go to the store and find the item. But when you get to the register to pay, you see a sign: “Hello! We’ve gone cashless.”
Situations like this may become common. More stores and restaurants have stopped taking cash as payment. Customers must pay with a credit card, a debit card, or a smartphone app. Some business owners say that going cashless has  their business. Staff members don’t have to worry about having enough money in the register to make change. They no longer have to take money to the bank.
But a lot of people say cashless stores are unfair. Some even say they should be illegal.
“It’s About Equity”
More than 8 million households in the United States don’t have bank accounts. That’s according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. And many people, including kids, don’t meet the requirements for a credit card.
“A cashless economy is not an  economy,” Tazra Mitchell told National Public Radio. She’s a policy director at the DC Fiscal Policy Institute. That’s in Washington, D.C. Mitchell says cashless stores are “discriminating against people.” And even those who have debit and credit cards might prefer paying with cash.
“Cash is still very popular with consumers,” Nick Bourke told TIME for Kids. He works at the Pew Charitable Trusts. Lawmakers in some places have taken steps to ban cashless stores. New York City and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, have already passed laws on the issue. In San Francisco, California, a law banning cashless stores was passed in May. It says most stores must allow customers to pay with cash.
Derek Remski helped write the San Francisco law. He works for the city. “It’s really about ,” Remski says. “It’s about understanding that not everyone has equal access to things.”

628,628,Talk to Me,"{'People', 'Media Literacy'}","
Before journalists write a story, they gather facts and details. One way they do this is with interviews.
Step one of conducting a successful interview? Research. “You don’t want to arrive at your interview clueless,” TFK Kid Reporter Zara Wierzbowski says. Take notes while you research. Later, this will help you write a list of specific questions for the person you’re interviewing. “Don’t just ask really basic questions,” TFK Kid Reporter Mira McInnes says. “Take the time to delve deeper.”
When it’s time for the interview, do as TFK Kid Reporter Nora Wilson-Hartgrove says: “Be extra prepared!” Whether the interview is in person or over the phone, be ready. Bring your audio-recording device, a notebook, and pens or pencils. Don’t forget your list of well-researched questions.
Then it’s time to talk—and listen. “Try to connect with them on a personal level and have a conversation,” TFK Kid Reporter Eshaan Mani says. 
Tricky Conversation
Some interviews are harder than others. For these, Jason Lipshutz has advice. He works at Billboard, a publication that covers the music business.
Lipshutz always does research before an interview. Still, people can surprise him. What does he do if the person he’s interviewing mentions a topic he’s not familiar with? “It’s okay to ask, ‘What do you mean?’ or ‘What is that?’” Lipshutz says. “It shows that you’re paying attention and want to learn more.”
Sometimes, journalists have to ask people about something difficult, such as a controversy. In these cases, Lipshutz says they should try to be sensitive. Instead of asking an uncomfortable question, address the topic indirectly. “See if they pick up the ball and run with it,” he says. If they open up, listen closely. “The Number 1 job of an interviewer is to listen,” he adds.
And if you’re nervous? TFK Kid Reporter Zara has wise words. “Stay calm,” she says. “The more you do it, the more you’ll get the hang of it.”

Patty Garvey-Darda loves pikas. They are small mammals related to rabbits. “I think they are about the cutest animals alive,” she told TIME for Kids. Garvey-Darda is a wildlife biologist. She works for the United States Forest Service. She wants to protect pikas and other creatures from a common threat: . The Federal Highway Administration says more than a million roadway accidents involving animals happen in the U.S. each year. These collisions hurt wildlife and people.

One solution to this problem? Wildlife crossings. In the U.S. and around the world, bridges and underpasses are being built to help animals safely cross roads.
Global Solution
Banff National Park in Alberta, Canada, has some of the most successful wildlife crossings. Completed in 2014, these include 38 underpasses and six overpasses, or bridges. They prevent the park’s animals from being hit while crossing the Trans-Canada Highway, which  the park. Parks Canada says the crossing system has reduced collisions with wildlife by more than 80%.

People study the Banff crossings as a guide for new construction projects, Rob Ament says. He works for the Western Transportation Institute at Montana State University. Ament notes Banff’s “high quality of design.” This includes fencing to direct animals away from roads.

Ament is using his expertise on wildlife crossings for a project in Assam, India. One of the state’s highways is on the border of Kaziranga National Park. “Animals leave the park to go up a dry hill during  season,” Ament says. “That means they have to cross the highway.” Plans are in the works for a safe pathway beneath it.
Under Construction
Wildlife crossings have been built in several U.S. states, including Arizona, Utah, and Wyoming. In Washington State, Garvey-Darda is part of a major project. She’s helping to design a set of about 20 wildlife crossings. “Banff has been the best model for us,” she says. Washington’s crossings are being built along a 15-mile stretch of Interstate 90 (I-90). That’s a long highway. This section of I-90 bisects the Cascade mountain range. It has disrupted the migration of animals in the area.

All 20 crossings are expected to be completed by 2029. So far, six underpasses and one overpass have been built. Garvey-Darda says these crossings have made a difference. “We now have close to 5,000 deer and elk going through the undercrossings,” she says. “All of these animals were potential accidents.”
This spring, Washington locals can plant vegetation on the I-90 overpass. Garvey-Darda says the plants will encourage animals, including her beloved pika, to use the crossings. “It’s important to be ,” she says, “and not wait until a species is endangered.”

New York State has banned single-use plastic bags. The new law went into effect on March 1. New York is one of several states to forbid stores from handing out plastic bags at checkout. California was the first. Many cities and counties in the United States already have similar laws.
Andrew Cuomo is New York’s governor. He proposed the ban last year. “For far too long, these bags have  our environment and clogged our waterways,” he said.
Officials say the ban will change people’s shopping habits.  Until now, New Yorkers used 23 billion plastic bags each year. The bags are harmful to birds and  animals. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency says some communities spend $1 million each year cleaning up litter. Much of it is grocery bags.
Businesses could pay up to $500 each time for breaking the law. Paper bags are allowed. But they may cost shoppers 5¢ each.
New York State leaders say people should keep reusable bags in their car or backpack. Small purchases may not need a bag at all.

634,634,An Ancient Craft,"{'Culture', 'World'}","
Welcome to the state of Oaxaca (wa-ha-ka), Mexico. Here, you’ll find the  town of San Martín Tilcajete. The town is rooted in ancient Zapotec culture. The Zapotec people have been living in the area for thousands of years. 
Look around, and you’ll spot wooden animal carvings. These figures are called tonas. Creating them is a Zapotec tradition. The craft has been passed down from generation to generation. 
But slowly, Zapotec culture is fading. Young people are leaving Oaxaca to find work in larger cities. Fewer people have the knowledge and skills needed to make tonas. 
One group hopes to change that. It’s called Jacobo y María Angeles. It teaches kids as young as 5 how to make tonas. Itzel Zuñiga works there. She spoke to TIME for Kids through an interpreter. “We’re trying to preserve the local Oaxacan culture,” she says.
Carving Out History 
The carvings take time and skill to create. They are made of soft wood from copal trees that grow in the area. The wood must be left out to dry for months before it can be carved into the shape of an animal. Tonas represent the Zapotec belief that each person is born with a spirit animal that acts as a protector. 

Decorating a tona can be a long process. Each figure tells its own story using tiny  painted on the carving. “Every glyph you see represents an idea,” Zuñiga says. “It all means something for Zapotec culture.”
Kids gather at Jacobo y María Angeles to learn from expert teachers. In workshops, the kids are taught about copal trees, and they learn to “see” an animal in a piece of wood. Then they get a tona to decorate. Many of the colors they use are made of natural ingredients, such as pomegranate, cactus, and corn. 
Some of these students might become expert teachers one day. Those who do will teach the next generation the Zapotec art of making tonas.

635,635,8 Questions for Jason Reynolds,"{'Books', 'Arts'}","
Author Jason Reynolds was recently named National Ambassador for Young People’s Literature by the Library of Congress. He spoke with TFK Kid Reporter Jack Doane.
1. What’s your goal as National Ambassador?
My goal is to visit small towns and encourage young people to share their stories. Stories aren’t just in books. Our lives are books in themselves. All of our stories are valuable.
2. You visit schools often. Why is that important to you?
My job is to show kids that the person who wrote these books is a regular person, a person with fears and desires and joy, just like them.
3. What’s it like to write a novel?
The truth is, it’s difficult. You can’t really master it. You just do the best you can, and make it as clear as possible. You try to make something beautiful with the words you know.
4. You write especially for young people? Why?
Who else is there to write for? I want to write about how interesting and  young people are.
5. What makes fiction so powerful for young people?
Fiction takes you into the lives of others. They might be suffering or being treated unfairly. And you learn to care about those people. That’s an amazing thing.
6. The boys in your novels show their emotions. Why is that?
I grew up in a neighborhood where boys couldn’t seem scared or sensitive. But boys can be all these things. I want to show them that it’s okay to have a range of emotions.
7. Why is diversity important in books?
America is a diverse country. It’s got people from all over the world, living all kinds of lives. That’s the beauty of our country. Why not have that beauty shown in our literature?
8. You publish books frequently. How do you do it?
I work six or seven hours every day. My mom worked for 50 years and never got an opportunity like this. So I never take it for granted.

Jennifer Keelan-Chaffins has a disorder called cerebral palsy. She uses a wheelchair. As a child, it was hard for her to do simple things like eat lunch with her friends in school, because there were no wheelchair ramps in the cafeteria.
When she was 8, Jennifer set aside her wheelchair and climbed the steps of the United States Capitol on her hands and knees. Her actions sent a message: Pass the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Lawmakers listened. Today, the ADA makes public spaces accessible to people with disabilities.
All the Way to the Top is Keelan-Chaffins’s story. “Jennifer had the power to inspire and to change the world,” author Annette Bay Pimentel told TFK. “I hope readers take away that they can make a difference and make a change.”

In March 2017, about 25 people were invited to San Francisco, California, for a tasting event. On the menu? Fried chicken. “This is some of the best fried chicken I’ve had,” one guest said.
That compliment was extra special considering the meat’s source. It had been grown in a lab by scientists from Memphis Meats. The company makes meat by   from animals. It feeds the cells nutrients. The cells grow and multiply, forming muscle, which is meat.

Memphis Meats is one of several companies in the United States making cellular, or lab-grown, meat. Many people think it’s better for the planet than raising animals for food. Others aren’t sure.
Why Cellular Meat?
The world’s population may be nearly 10 billion by 2050. That’s according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Eric Schulze is a vice president at Memphis Meats. He thinks feeding that many people will be tough. “With current meat production methods, there aren’t enough resources” such as land to do so, Schulze told TIME for Kids.
Meat production also requires cows. Cows release . This gas contributes to climate change. Cows use a lot of space, too. Most of the world’s farmland is used to grow crops to feed livestock or for . This leads to deforestation.

Cellular meat needs fewer cows and less land. Schulze says cells taken in one extraction can make more meat than “any single animal could ever produce.” How much land is needed? “You only need the land required for the facility” where the meat is made, says Elliot Swartz of the Good Food Institute. This group promotes cellular meat and plant-based “meat” (see “Plant Power”).
Challenges Ahead
Not everyone thinks cellular meat will help the planet. Alison Van Eenennaam studies animal science at the University of California, Davis. She says , such as coal, power cellular-meat facilities. Burning these fuels releases another gas that affects the planet: carbon dioxide. “If we’re burning coal so that we can grow cellular meat,” she asks, “are we going backward?”

Cellular meat isn’t in stores. Before that can happen, it needs to be affordable. The first lab-grown burger was produced in 2013. It cost more than $300,000 to make. Costs are dropping. But they can’t yet compete with regular ground beef. That’s about $4 a pound.
The U.S. government must also pass regulations to ensure that cellular meat is safely produced. But it’s unclear how long that will take.
Plant Power
Some people choose not to eat meat, or to eat less of it. For them, plant-based “meat” could be a tasty substitute. To make it, scientists study why meat looks and tastes the way it does. Then they use plants to copy these qualities.
Companies like Impossible Foods and Beyond Meat sell their plant-based products in grocery stores. You can also find plant-based options everywhere from fancy restaurants to fast-food chains such as Burger King, Carl’s Jr., and Dunkin’.

Basketball stars came together in Chicago, Illinois, on February 16. They were there for the NBA All-Star Game. The game has been played every year since 1951. Teams are made of the NBA’s top players. This year, Team LeBron played Team Giannis. The first team was captained by LeBron James, of the Los Angeles Lakers. The other was led by Giannis Antetokounmpo, of the Milwaukee Bucks.
The game served as a tribute to Lakers legend Kobe Bryant. He and his daughter Gianna were among those killed in a helicopter crash in January. “His presence was felt,” James said.
Players on Team Giannis wore the number 24, Bryant’s jersey number. Team LeBron players wore a 2. That was Gianna’s number. She wore it for her youth basketball team.
The game had new scoring rules. At the end of the third quarter, 24 points were added to the number of points scored by the leading team, to honor Bryant. This created a target score of 157. The first team to reach 157 would win. It made for an intense fourth quarter. Team LeBron won 157 to 155.

A United States Coast Guard facility was attacked in December 2019. Its monitoring systems, cameras, and doors stopped working. The source of the attack? An employee had opened an email and clicked on a link. The link contained malware. Malware is software that damages computers.
Cyberattacks like this are becoming more common. The National Security Agency (NSA) works to protect the country’s computers from them. “Banking, health care, energy, transportation—they all rely on having  cybersecurity,” Diane M. Janosek of the NSA told TIME for Kids.
But the NSA has a problem: There aren’t enough people trained to do cybersecurity. There will be 3.5 million unfilled cybersecurity jobs by 2021. That’s according to a 2017 report from Cybersecurity Ventures. To help fill the gap, the NSA and the National Science Foundation sponsor cybersecurity camps for elementary, middle, and high school students. The program is called GenCyber.
Next Generation
The first GenCyber camps opened in 2014. Now there are 150 around the country. They are all free for students.
Ibrahim Baggili runs a camp at the University of New Haven, in Connecticut. There, students learn the basics of programming in Python. That’s the coding language used by many hackers. They also learn about cyber  and defense.
In one activity, students investigate a crime scene. Physical clues lead them to a phone number. When they call the number, they’re given a Twitter account. Finally, they must decrypt a message. To decrypt a coded message means to make it readable.
Cybersecurity is always changing, Baggili says. “Every day, you’re going to be facing a different challenge. Someone is going to attack you, and you have to defend yourself.”

Piper Leypoldt, 11, is from Durham, North Carolina. She watches cooking videos on YouTube. Piper knows that the site collects user data, such as her search history. She’s not worried. “Other websites I use at home and school also collect my information,” she says.
But  for online privacy are worried. In September, YouTube agreed to pay a $170 million penalty. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) said the site collected kids’ data and used it to target them with ads. The FTC says YouTube did this without parents’ . That made it illegal.
Kristen Walker is a professor at California State University. She studies how kids share information online. “The Internet is so convenient,” she says. “It’s easy not to feel a need to be careful.” And you never know who will access your data, she warns: “The harm is a long-term consequence. We can’t see the danger until it’s too late.”
The Data Trail
YouTube started in 2005. A year later, Google bought it. The site is built to keep you watching. Artificial intelligence learns what videos you like and recommends similar content. The more you watch, the more ads you see. (YouTube makes money by selling ads.)
The site also uses bits of data that are stored on your device. They can be used to track your searches across the Internet.
YouTube has agreed to limit the data it collects on videos for kids. It will also require content creators to identify videos made for children. This is so YouTube can make sure to follow the law.
Advocacy groups say it’s not enough. They say YouTube should decide if a video is for kids. Otherwise, “it’s like having a school playground with no one responsible for watching the kids and making sure the equipment is safe,” wrote Susan Grant. She works for the Consumer Federation of America.
For now, kids like Piper will need to decide: Is watching videos on YouTube worth the risk?

645,645,Remembering the March,"{'United States', 'History'}","
On August 28, 1963, people poured into Washington, D.C. Many held signs: “We March for  Schools Now!” and “We Demand Jobs for All Now!”
The event was called the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. It drew about 250,000 people. They were calling on the United States government to pass laws guaranteeing equal rights for all Americans. At the Lincoln Memorial, they heard Martin Luther King Jr. give one of the most important speeches in our nation’s history.

The Life of a Leader
King was born in Atlanta, Georgia, in 1929. He became a minister and moved to Montgomery, Alabama. He preached often about his dream of equality for all. But in the 1950s, segregation was a fact of life in many parts of the country, especially in the South.
In 1955, an African-American teenager named Claudette Colvin was arrested in Montgomery, Alabama. She had refused to give up her seat on a bus to a white person. Rosa Parks was arrested soon after for a similar act of protest. This led to a yearlong  of public buses in Montgomery. It also led to a U.S. Supreme Court decision that banned segregated seating on buses.
In April 1963, King helped lead a protest in Birmingham, Alabama. He was arrested and jailed. That only motivated him. A few months later, he joined other civil rights leaders for the March on Washington. It was organized by Bayard Rustin and A. Philip Randolph. Many leaders spoke before King. His speech lasted 18 minutes.
“I have a dream,” he said, “that one day this nation will rise up, live out the true meaning of its : ‘We hold these truths to be , that all men are created equal,’” King said toward the end. “I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their .”
“He was preaching from his heart,” says John Lewis. He is now a U.S. congressman in Georgia.

The Dream Lives On
The March on Washington showed Americans the power of peaceful protest. The following year, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act. It banned .
Maxine Allen Johnson Wood took part in the March on Washington. She had just graduated from college. She says King’s dream is still important today. “The image that he gave was [of] a future. And it wasn’t beyond our reality to think that [it] could happen.”
King’s words continue to inspire people around the world. “Of all the gifts [he gave us], the greatest has been the belief in society’s ability to change and the power each of us has to effect that change,” Lewis says.

“I Was There”
What was it like to attend the March on Washington? TIME magazine spoke with people who were there. They remember how King led the crowd in raising a voice for equality.

“I’d never seen anything like it. I remember the electricity in the air.”

646,646,TFK Explains: Coronavirus,"{'World', 'Health'}","
This story appears in the February 21, 2020, print edition of TIME for Kids. It was published online on February 13. It has not been updated.
The coronavirus  that began in China has been called a public health emergency. Scientists are working to stop the spread and find a cure. 
What is coronavirus?
Coronaviruses are a group of viruses that can infect animals and people. Some cause mild illness, like the common cold. Others can lead to serious illness. The type causing the current outbreak is new to scientists. 
How did the outbreak spread?
The new coronavirus was first seen in December. It has been linked to a market in Wuhan, China. It’s possible the virus moved from animals to humans there. But people who didn’t go to the market now have the virus. So experts know it can spread between people.
How is the outbreak being handled?
People in at least 14 cities in China have been told to stay home. Schools, markets, and transportation systems have been closed. Many places, including the United States, have travel rules in place. They affect people who live in China and who have recently been to China. 
On February 11, the illness was named COVID-19. Scientists around the world are working on a cure. The World Health Organization says it is doing everything possible to stop the spread. 
What are the symptoms? 
Symptoms include fever, coughing, and difficulty breathing. In rare cases, the illness can be deadly.
How many people have been affected?
At press time, China has confirmed nearly 60,000 cases of COVID-19. More than 1,300 people in China have died. Outside mainland China, there have been 441 confirmed cases and three deaths. Only 14 cases have been confirmed in the U.S. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the virus “is not currently spreading” in the U.S. 
What can I do to stay healthy?
It’s very unlikely you or anyone you know in the U.S. will catch COVID-19. But flu and other illnesses are common in winter. See “Staying Healthy” to learn how to protect yourself against illness in general. If you have questions, talk to a trusted adult.
Stop and Think! How do you know news about a public health issue is trustworthy? There’s a lot of misinformation about COVID-19. How can people sort fact from fiction?

650,650,Impeachment Trial Ends,"{'United States', 'Government'}","
The impeachment trial of President Donald Trump ended on February 5, when the United States Senate voted against removing him from office. 
In a U.S. impeachment trial, 67 votes are needed to find the president guilty. The senators voted on two different charges. On the first, abuse of power, 48 senators voted guilty and 52 voted not guilty. On the second, obstruction of Congress, 47 senators voted guilty and 53 voted not guilty. The vote marked the end of months of proceedings.
The Impeachment Process
The impeachment inquiry began in the U.S. House of Representatives after an anonymous complaint was filed in August. The complaint said Trump pressured Ukraine to interfere in the 2020 U.S. presidential election. On December 18, the House voted to impeach President Trump. He was charged with abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. 
The Senate trial began on January 21. All 100 senators served as the jury. Seven members of the House argued that the president should be removed from office. A team of lawyers defended the president. They argued that he should not be removed from office. Senators listened to both sides and submitted written questions. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts oversaw the trial. He read the questions aloud. Both sides were given time to respond.
On January 31, the Senate voted against hearing from new witnesses or requesting more evidence. After each side made its closing argument, senators were given time to make statements. Finally, on February 5, senators voted on the two articles of impeachment. One by one, senators were called by name and asked to vote guilty or not guilty on each charge.
This impeachment trial was not the first of its kind. It was the third in U.S. history. All three presidents put on trial were found not guilty. No president has ever been removed from office.

651,651,Bananas at Risk,"{'Business', 'World'}","
Bananas are one of the most important crops on Earth. They are a top source of food and money for millions of people. But all around the world, banana plants are dying. They’re being attacked by a form of Panama disease called Tropical Race 4 (TR4).
For years, farmers and experts have been afraid that TR4 would hit Latin America and the Caribbean. About 85% of bananas  worldwide are grown there. On August 8, 2019, those fears came true. Cases of TR4 were confirmed at six banana farms in Colombia. The country declared a national emergency. “In Colombia, [TR4] is incredibly difficult to control,” scientist James Dale told TIME for Kids. “Everybody is absolutely  about what’s going to happen.”

When Good Bananas Go Bad 
TR4 is a fungus that lives in soil. It infects banana plants through the roots. It moves into the stems. There, it stops water and nutrients from entering the plant’s leaves. The plant turns yellow. Then it dries up and dies. TR4 spreads easily, from plant to plant and farm to farm. “No country is  to the disease,” says Fazil Dusunceli of the Food and Agriculture Organization.
Part of the problem is that 99% of exported bananas are of the same type: Cavendish. This lack of variety is not good for nature. Why? All Cavendish bananas are very similar. So when a disease like TR4 strikes, they are all equally at risk. “Eating Cavendish [bananas] is making the situation worse,” says Altus Viljoen. He’s a professor who studies plant diseases.

Viljoen and others say we should  the types of bananas we are growing and eating. This would mean turning to less-common types of bananas, such as the Manzano. It tastes like apple and strawberry.
An Uncertain Future
People in the banana industry are coming together. They want to save the tropical fruit. James Dale, for example, is working with a team of scientists in Australia to introduce a new type of banana. It is  to TR4. But some people are against scientists creating new types of plants in a lab. They say people shouldn’t mess with nature.

Not everyone is worried about the fruit. “I think there’s a great future for bananas,” Andrew Biles says. He’s an adviser to Chiquita. That’s one of the world’s biggest banana companies.
This isn’t the first time bananas have been in trouble (see “Looking Back”). Even if we find a solution to today’s banana , will history repeat itself, yet again, in decades to come? “Oh, I’m certain it will,” Dale says.
Looking Back

Before the 1950s, nearly all the bananas sold in the U.S. were one type. Then Panama disease hit. The banana industry needed a replacement. It chose the Cavendish. This was similar to the banana popular at the time. But it was resistant to Panama disease.
In the 1990s, a new kind of Panama disease, called TR4, hit crops. This put the fruit at risk again.

A team of lawyers will defend the president. They will argue that the evidence does not call for his removal.
At the end, senators will vote. If at least 67 find Trump guilty, he will be removed from office. This is unlikely to happen. Trump is a Republican, and Republicans lead the Senate. Many have indicated they will support Trump.
This is the third impeachment trial in U.S. history. The first was for Andrew Johnson, in 1868. The second was for Bill Clinton, in 1999. Neither was removed from  office.

Students In Action
On a fall afternoon, students at the Brooklyn Academy of Global Finance will take part in Inside Out. One by one, they climb into the truck’s photo booth to have their picture taken. Their faces come out of a slot in the truck’s side on black-and-white posters.

Dannielle Darbee is the school principal. She climbs into the booth. The students cheer. “There’s a positive buzz today,” Darbee says after having her picture taken. She notes that the school doesn’t have a regular art teacher. “So when we get an opportunity to do something artistic, we take it,” she says.

The narrator of Sunnyside Plaza is 19-year-old Sally Miyake. She lives at Sunnyside Plaza, a group home for people with developmental disabilities. Sal has trouble understanding some things, but she has many gifts. “I can’t read,” she explains, “but I see, I hear, and I notice things.” When two residents of Sunnyside Plaza mysteriously die, Sal uses her powers of observation to help detectives solve the case.
Author Scott Simon says he was inspired by his time working at a group home in Chicago when he was in college. But Simon told TFK it was important to him to tell the story from the viewpoint of a resident of the home rather than that of someone who visits or works there. “The idea of novels is empathy, isn’t it?” he says. “You cast yourself into another skin, another mind and heart.”

Jailynne Garcia loves the South Korean pop group BTS. She’s 10 years old. Her mom introduced her to the group. “I like how funny they are, that they’re good dancers and singers. And that they help people,” Jailynne told TIME for Kids.
BTS  in 2013. There are seven members. They are J-Hope, Jimin, Jin, Jung Kook, RM, Suga, and V. Their songs are mostly in Korean. But they are international superstars. Their YouTube videos have gotten more than 3 billion views. They had three Number 1 albums on the Billboard chart in a year. And TIME included BTS on its list of the 100 most influential people in 2019. Their next album comes out in February.

Fans like Jailynne are proud members of the BTS ARMY. (ARMY stands for Adorable Representative M.C. for Youth.) BTS are glad their fans feel connected to them. “That was our goal, to create this  that people can relate to,” Suga told TIME in 2018.
The Band Gives Back

In March 2019, the Korea Times reported that Suga donated $88,000 to the Korea Pediatric Cancer Foundation. RM gave away more than $83,000 six months later. That went to the Seoul Samsung School. The money helped students with hearing impairment. BTS are also working with Formula E electric cars this year to raise awareness about climate change. The band wants its fans to embrace clean energy.
One of the biggest BTS  so far is with the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF). The campaign is called Love Myself. Its goal is to protect children and teens from violence. “Our fans have become a major part of this campaign with their action and enthusiasm,” RM said.
He gave a speech at the United Nations in 2018. “We truly have the best fans in the world.” Love Myself raised $2.3 million. The money came from album and merchandise sales. Plus there were donations from BTS, its record label, and the BTS ARMY.

Pay It Forward
Jailynne and her mom are inspired by BTS. They joined the BTS fan group One in an ARMY (OIAA). It leads projects to help people in need. OIAA started in 2018. “Some of us thought, ‘Wouldn’t it be amazing if we focused all that power to do good things in the world?’” Erika Overton says. She is an OIAA volunteer.
The group has run about 20 charitable campaigns since it began.OIAA has raised money for , the environment, and more. Most people donate just a dollar. That way, “everyone can feel like they are contributing toward the goal,” Overton says.
Jailynne hopes the BTS ARMY will grow and continue to do good deeds. “The more people like me that are doing this, the more happiness it brings to others. And a bigger change there is in the world,” she says.
Growing Good

One way the BTS ARMY gives back is by planting trees. Some fans donate to One Tree Planted. This group plants trees around the world. The BTS ARMY has raised more than $28,000 for One Tree Planted.
In Malaysia, the fan group BTS for Charity (above) formed the Green Namu Project. The group met in November. They planted trees to celebrate the birthdays of three BTS members.

Britain’s Prince Harry and Meghan Markle made an announcement on January 8. The duke and duchess of Sussex said they would “step back as ‘senior’ members” of the royal family. The message appeared on their Instagram page.
The two say they want to lead lives separate from the royal family. They plan to support themselves financially. They will split their time between the United Kingdom and North America.
No member of the royal family has ever “stepped back” in this way. A royal’s job is to support  and do other work that benefits the public.
Harry and Meghan said they will “honor our duty” to Britain. But they plan to focus on their own charity. They also want privacy as they raise their son, Archie. They say British newspapers have printed unfair stories about them.
On January 13, Queen Elizabeth  a statement. The royal family is “supportive of Harry and Meghan’s desire to create a new life,” she said. “We respect and understand their wish.”
Stop and Think! Why does the press report on public figures, such as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle? What might lead a public figure to say that a story is unfair?

660,660,Teen Finds New Planet,"{'Science', 'Space'}","
NASA recently announced a new planet. It was discovered by 17-year-old Wolf Cukier during his summer internship at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, in Maryland. Wolf monitored data collected from TESS, a NASA satellite. TESS stands for Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite. Its mission is to find planets outside our solar system.
Wolf noticed a signal from planetary system TOI 1338. TOI stands for TESS Object of Interest. “I thought it was a stellar eclipse, but the timing was wrong,” he said, according to NASA. “It turned out to be a planet.”
The planet is called TOI 1338 b. It’s nearly seven times the size of Earth. It’s “like Tatooine from Star Wars” because it orbits two stars, Wolf told TIME for Kids.

Read an edited interview with Wolf below.
Tell us about your internship at NASA.
I got the NASA internship as part of the science-research program at my high school. My job was to look through previously collected data from the TESS.
What is TESS?
TESS is the telescope satellite that launched a couple of years ago to collect data. It was a joint collaboration between NASA and MIT [the Massachusetts Institute of Technology].
How did you find the new planet?
It took some time. I was working with my mentor at NASA, Veselin Kostov. We were trying to find a circumbinary planet within the TESS data. A circumbinary planet is a planet that orbits two stars at the same time—so like Tatooine, from Star Wars.
I found about a hundred potentially interesting targets. I brought all of them to my mentor. But one was the most exciting of them all. I put about 10 asterisks next to it in my spreadsheet.
How do you feel about all of the attention your discovery is getting?
All the coverage is kind of overwhelming, because I thought it would make a small ripple in science news and that would be about it. But this is like the 17th or 18th interview I've given! It amazes me how much this has been covered.
What advice do you have for kids who aspire to make scientific discoveries?
I would tell them to just do stuff! I joined the science-olympiad team at my middle school, and that was a great experience. I'm still doing science olympiad now in high school. I would tell people that if they want to do science, just start doing science: tinker with stuff, or do a project.

661,661,Closing the Gap,"{'Places', 'Technology'}","
Students in Talladega County, Alabama, are given a laptop or a tablet. They use them in class and at home.
But Talladega County is in  Alabama. Many students live in small towns or in the countryside. Internet access is delivered using towers and underground cables. But they don’t always reach these areas. In some homes, it’s impossible to access the Internet.
Experts call this the “homework gap.” That’s because it’s difficult for some students to do homework online. “When you go home at the end of the day and you can no longer access the same information and technology tools as some of your classmates—that’s the homework gap,” Beth Holland told TIME for Kids. She works at the Consortium for School Networking.
Driving Change
About one in five homes with school-age kids doesn’t have high-speed Internet access. That’s according to a Pew Research study. And 17% of teens say lack of steady Internet sometimes means they can’t do homework. “Kids are being  from learning opportunities,” Holland says.
Schools around the country have found creative ways to close the homework gap. In some school libraries, students can borrow mobile hot spots. These use cell-phone networks to access the Internet. Students in some communities have created Wi-Fi maps. These let kids know about local businesses, such as cafés, which provide Internet to their customers.
Talladega County created “rolling study halls.” Many students ride the bus to and from school each day. The average ride each way is an hour. Some are as long as 90 minutes.
In 2018, wireless Internet was installed on six school buses. Now students do homework while they ride. A teacher comes along to help.
Vicky Ozment is the deputy superintendent for Talladega County Schools. She says rolling study halls have “leveled the playing field.”

662,662,Find the Facts,"{'Business', 'People'}","
More than half of teens learn about the news from social-media sources and YouTube videos. That’s according to a 2019 Common Sense Media survey. But the information on those sites is not always trustworthy.
“There’s more misinformation out there than ever,” Jordan Mamone says. He works as a fact-checker at TIME for Kids. “It’s really important to learn about your sources,” he adds. Mamone works with writers and editors to make sure people can trust what they read.
Getting It Right
Mamone  all of the facts in an issue of TFK before it is published. How does he do this? First, he reads each article. He underlines information that can be proven. Examples include numbers and historical details. He then looks for a primary source to confirm the information. Primary sources are firsthand accounts. They include official websites and autobiographies.
If Mamone can’t find a primary source, he’ll look for three secondary sources to confirm a fact. Secondary sources describe what a primary source says. They include newspaper articles and books. Mamone doesn’t rely on every secondary source. He avoids those that are outdated or . He also skips sources that may not have been fact-checked. These include personal blogs.
Merrill Fabry is also a fact-checker. She works for TIME magazine. When fact-checking, she pays attention to even the smallest details. “For example, if someone writes ‘a stack of books’ in an article, I need to find out if it’s really a ‘stack’ or if it’s just a couple of books,” Fabry says.
What’s the best part of being a fact-checker? “I really enjoy getting to work with writers and editors,” Fabry says. “It can be very .” Mamone sees another benefit: “The topics that you’re researching are constantly changing,” he says. “You’re always learning!”

What do you imagine when you hear the word inventor? Many people picture Thomas Edison holding a lightbulb, or Alexander Graham Bell talking on the first telephone. But not all inventors are in our history books.
New inventions are being dreamed up and designed every day. Today’s inventors follow the same path that inventors did in the past: They identify a problem and create something to solve it. That can sometimes mean overcoming obstacles, but inventors always find a way. 
TIME for Kids spoke to six young inventors who have done just that. They are improving the world and making history. 
Two Helpful Apps

Neil Deshmukh’s introduction to  (AI) came three years ago. He wanted to keep his little brother out of his bedroom. That way, he could keep him away from his Nintendo DS. So Neil built a device. It could tell the difference between his brother’s face and Neil’s own. It would then lock or unlock the door. “In the very beginning, I was a tinkerer,” Neil told TFK. 
Neil is now 17. He has created two apps. One of them is PlantumAI. It uses data to help farmers detect and  crop disease. The other is called VocalEyes. It describes photographs out loud. This helps people who are blind or who have low vision.
Neil has a personal interest in the problems he’s chosen to tackle. In India, he saw the effect of crop disease on a village near where his parents were born. And his grandmother has low vision. He created VocalEyes with her in mind.
Neil lives in Pennsylvania. His work has won awards from companies such as Google, T-Mobile, and General Motors. —By Rebecca Katzman
 A Better Cane

Riya Karumanchi met a woman who had trouble seeing. The woman used a white cane to get around. Riya was surprised that even with the cane, the woman struggled. She often bumped into objects that stood higher than knee level. 
Riya assumed the cane came with cutting-edge technology. But she soon learned that wasn’t true. “It’s just a stick,” she says. “My initial thought was like, ‘What? How is nobody working on this?’”
Riya decided to work on it herself. At age 14, she engineered a device. It’s now called SmartCane. It uses sensors to spot obstacles and wet surfaces. It vibrates to alert the user to a dangerous situation. GPS navigation gives directions through vibrations and audio. An emergency button connects the user to first responders or loved ones.
Riya is now 16 and a high school student in Canada. She’s also the founder and CEO of the SmartCane company. She hopes to one day distribute the device through the Canadian National Institute for the Blind. —By Shay Maunz
Braigo for the Blind

Shubham Banerjee loved Legos as a kid. But he didn’t use the classic plastic bricks to build castles or spaceships. He used them to make a product that could help people who are blind.
At age 12, Shubham needed an idea for a science fair. He was inspired by a flyer. It asked for donations for the blind. Shubham used the materials in his Lego Mindstorms EV3 robotics kit to create a Braille printer. It was much cheaper and lighter than any other Braille printer available.
A year later, Shubham and his parents founded a company. It’s called Braigo Labs Inc. Shubham made a new, metal version of the printer with help from . That printer would cost $350 to buy. Other Braille printers can cost $2,000.
Shubham is now 18. He’s studying business and engineering at the University of California, Berkeley. He has  for the Braigo printer. But he’s not sure what he’ll do with them. He says he might sell the company or “hold off until after my studies.” —By Ellen Nam
Passion for STEM

When she was 7, Gitanjali Rao invented a new kind of folding chair. Her design didn’t work. But that didn’t stop her from coming up with ideas. 
Now 14, Gitanjali is an experienced inventor. In 2017, she won the 3M Young Scientist Challenge for Tethys. Tethys is a device that detects lead in drinking water. Gitanjali invented it after learning about the water crisis in Flint, Michigan. “I really wanted to go after this problem,” she says. “Each and every one of us has a right to know what’s in our water.”
Gitanjali’s new invention tackles cyberbullying. It’s an app called Kindly. Kindly spots and prevents mean online messages. “I’m going to throw a launch party at school,” says the ninth grader from Lone Tree, Colorado. “You need a party for everything.”
Gitanjali isn’t always in the lab. She also enjoys teaching. Her “innovation sessions” have attracted about 20,000 kids. “My mom has always told me that I’m good at explaining complicated concepts,” she says. “I want to work with students to find and develop their passion for STEM.” —By Jaime Joyce
Warming Up the Water

Xóchitl Guadalupe Cruz López grew up in a home that was often without hot water. So did many of the other residents of her hometown of San Cristóbal de las Casas. That’s in Chiapas, Mexico. 
When she was 8, Xóchitl invented Warm Bath. It’s a solar-powered water heater made from recycled materials. “People here have to take baths with cold water. They have a lot of diseases,” she says, through an interpreter. “I wanted to do something.”
The Warm Bath  is made of objects that are easy to get. These include water bottles, a rubber hose, and plastic connectors. It costs about $30 to assemble. 
Xóchitl, who’s now 11, created Warm Bath with the National Autonomous University of Mexico’s adopt-a-talent science program, PAUTA. In 2018, Xóchitl was the first child to receive the university’s Institute of Nuclear Sciences Recognition for Women award. When she found out, “the only thing I could think about was telling my parents and my brother,” she says. —By Constance Gibbs
Saving the Seas

Fionn Ferreira, 19, has always loved the sea. He grew up near the ocean, in Ireland. He often went kayaking and volunteered at beach cleanups. And Fionn has always loved science. His two passions met in 2017. That’s when he began looking for an eco-friendly way to remove microplastics from water. 
The process Fionn developed won him the 2019 Google Science Fair. His method uses a magnetic liquid. It’s called ferrofluid. When added to water, ferrofluid sticks to microplastics. Magnets can then be used to remove the ferrofluid from the water. More than 85% of the microplastics are removed along with it, Fionn says.
Fionn built most of the tools he needed to test his method at home. There were hiccups along the way. “Some worked. Some didn’t. Some things blew up. Some caught fire,” he says. “The fuses of our house were constantly blowing!”
Fionn wants to continue his research. He also wants to inspire more kids to get involved in STEM. —By Karena Phan

Since September, bush fires have been burning in Australia. Drought and a heat wave are feeding the flames. Officials say this fire season is one of the worst in the country’s history.
“We have no idea where this is going to end,” David Bowman says. He’s a scientist at the University of Tasmania. “Australia’s vegetation is highly flammable. The fire [is] not going to run out of fuel.”
Wildfire has burned about 17 million acres so far. That’s more than twice the size of the state of Maryland. At least 25 people have died. Thousands have been evacuated.
Aid has poured in from around the world. New Zealand, Canada, and the United States have sent firefighters and other helpers. Australia’s military is delivering food and water to affected towns.
Scott Morrison is Australia’s prime minister. On January 6, he said his government would spend an additional 2 billion Australian dollars ($1.4 billion U.S.) to rebuild damaged towns. He had already promised AUD $20 million ($14 million U.S.) for the recovery effort.

Australia is a major producer of . They are a cause of climate change. Hot, dry weather makes wildfires worse. Critics say Morrison is not doing enough to fight climate change. Morrison says his government is “meeting and beating” its targets. He also argues that climate change is just one of “many other factors” causing the fires.
The bush fires have had a big impact on wildlife. Areas where species such as the koala live are being wiped out. Animal-rescue teams have landed on Kangaroo Island, in South Australia. Heidi Groffen is an ecologist. She thinks some mouselike dunnarts there may have found safety in rock . “We’re hoping to bring some into captivity before they are completely gone,” Groffen says.

672,672,TFK Reads: Pavi Sharma's Guide to Going Home,"{'Books', 'Time Off'}","
Pavi Sharma’s Guide to Going Home, by Bridget Farr, is about a girl who has become an expert on foster care. After staying in several different foster homes, she’s now living with a wonderful, loving family. She uses her experience to help other kids find their way to foster families that are as great as her own.
Pavi Sharma’s Guide to Going Home is one of TFK’s recommended books of 2019. After we chose our picks, we handed them off to our team of TFK Kid Reporters. Here, TFK Kid Reporter Alexis Bumah shares her review.
We’ll be posting more reviews throughout our winter break. Check back next Monday to read about My Life as an Ice Cream Sandwich, by Ibi Zoboi.

Pavi Sharma is a 12-year-old who lives with her foster mom, Marjorie, and her foster brother, Hamilton. Pavi runs her own “business” in which she prepares other kids to meet their foster families. She makes sure they know how to do a proper “Front Door Face.” That’s the perfect smile to be used when arriving at a foster family’s home for the first time.
One day, Pavi finds out that a little girl is going to be sent to the worst foster home Pavi has ever stayed in. So Pavi enlists the help of some schoolmates to embark on an ambitious journey: to save her new young friend from a bad home.
Pavi and her friends are extremely believable, especially when it comes to their sense of curiosity. The characters make readers feel as if they are in the book. I think Pavi Sharma’s Guide to Going Home would be enjoyable for anyone with an adventurous spirit or who loves plot twists. I give this book a 9 out of 10. It was captivating.

673,673,Frederick Douglass,"{'TFK Library', 'History'}","
In the years leading up to the Civil War, Frederick Douglass (February 1818—February 20, 1895) was the most powerful speaker and writer of the abolitionist movement.
Frederick Douglass was born into slavery in Talbot County, Maryland. He was raised by his grandmother, who was a slave. He was taken from her when he was a child and sent to Baltimore, Maryland. There, he worked as a servant in the household of shipbuilder Hugh Auld. Auld’s wife, Sophia, began teaching young Frederick to read and write. Then her husband told her to stop. It was against the law to teach a slave to read. But young Frederick found a way to keep learning. White friends secretly gave him books. 
As Douglass grew up, he developed ideas against slavery. He believed in human equality. He found that idea in the Declaration of Independence. Eventually, he was sent back to the Maryland plantation where he was born. There, he gained a reputation for disobedience. This was partly because he was teaching other slaves how to read the Bible. 
Before long, Douglass was sent to work for Edward Covey. Covey was known as a brutal “slave breaker.” He whipped his slaves. In his autobiography, Douglass writes about his victory over Covey. They fought hand to hand. After that, Covey never whipped Douglass again. In 1838, Douglass escaped from slavery. He disguised himself as a sailor and headed north. He made his way to New York City. 

The Abolitionist
In New York City, Douglass married Anna Murray. The couple settled in New Bedford, Massachusetts. They lived in a community of free black people. They became active in the  movement. Abolitionists wanted to abolish slavery. Douglass was a good storyteller. His stories about his life as a slave got the attention of William Lloyd Garrison. He was the editor of the abolitionist newspaper The Liberator. Garrison encouraged Douglass to write about his experiences. The result was the Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, An American Slave. The book was published in 1845. It became a best-seller.
In 1847, Douglass’s supporters raised money to buy his freedom. He moved to Rochester, New York, and started an antislavery newspaper. It was called The North Star. In 1848, he spoke at a women’s-rights conference in Seneca Falls, New York. There, he met civil rights advocate Elizabeth Cady Stanton.
Power and Influence
During the Civil War, 1861–1865, Douglass asked President Abraham Lincoln to allow black men to join the Union Army. Two of Douglass’s sons, Charles and Lewis, joined the 54th Massachusetts Infantry. After the war, Douglass used his fame to the promote the passage of the 14th and 15th Amendments to the Constitution. These gave all American men equal rights, including the right to vote. The 13th Amendment, passed in 1865, had abolished slavery.
Later, Douglass held high-ranking positions in the U.S. government. He was ambassador to the Dominican Republic and Haiti. He was also director of the Freedman’s Bank. He spoke out against racial inequality and defended human rights. 
Douglass died in 1895, in Washington, D.C. He had just attended a meeting for the National Council of Women. Thousands of mourners attended his funeral.

674,674,Fannie Lou Hamer,"{'TFK Library', 'History'}","
Fannie Lou Hamer (October 6, 1917—March 14, 1977) was a civil rights activist. She fought to expand voting rights for African Americans.
Fannie Lou Hamer was born in Montgomery County, Mississippi, during a time of segregation. African Americans in the South couldn’t eat at the same restaurants as white people. They couldn’t go to the same schools either. 
Hamer’s parents worked long hours on a cotton farm. She began picking cotton when she was only 6 years old. By age 12, Hamer had dropped out of school. She began working full-time in the fields.
But Hamer’s life changed in 1962. That’s when she attended a civil rights meeting. She was 45 years old. “They talked about how it was our rights as human beings to register and vote,” she told the New York Times. “I never knew we could vote before. Nobody ever told us.” 
At the time, African Americans had the legal right to vote. But many Southern states made it extremely difficult for them to register to vote. For example, African Americans often had to pass literacy tests before they could register. The tests required them to read and understand complicated government documents. In addition, many African Americans who attempted to register faced violence.
Braving Threats
Despite these challenges, Hamer decided to brave the voter-registration process. In 1962, she took a bus to the Sunflower County Courthouse, in Mississippi. There, she was allowed to complete the paperwork. But she was not allowed to register. Why? She was told she had failed the literacy test. 
Hamer’s right to vote was also challenged by her boss. He gave her a choice. She could either withdraw her voter-registration application or lose her job. Hamer walked off the plantation. She dedicated herself to the civil rights movement.

Call to Action
Within a few months, Hamer began working as an organizer with a major civil rights group. She traveled around the South to educate black people about voting rights. Her life was threatened many times.
In 1963, Hamer was arrested in Charleston, South Carolina, on false charges. In jail, she was badly beaten. The attack left her with kidney damage and a limp. But the beating didn’t stop Hamer from continuing her fight for justice.
In 1964, Hamer organized Freedom Summer. It was a major effort in Mississippi to help African Americans register to vote. That same year, she gained national attention when she spoke at the Democratic National Convention. It was held in Atlantic City, New Jersey.
During her speech, Hamer described the terrible effect of segregation. She also explained why the convention’s Mississippi delegation should be integrated. “Is this America, the land of the free and the home of the brave,” she said, “where we have to sleep with our telephones off the hooks because our lives be threatened daily because we want to live as decent human beings—in America?” 
Hamer’s speech was televised around the country. It became a key moment of the civil rights movement. Four years later, Hamer achieved her goal. She joined an integrated delegation from Mississippi at the 1968 Democratic National Convention. 
For the rest of her life, Hamer would continue to champion black voting rights. Andrew Young Jr. spoke at her funeral. He was U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. According to the New York Times, Young said that the civil rights movement was indebted to the “sweat and blood” of activists like Hamer.

675,675,"Martin Luther King, Jr.","{'TFK Library', 'History'}","
Martin Luther King Jr. is considered one of history’s greatest activists. His leadership helped end  during the civil rights movement.
When Martin Luther King Jr. was born, his parents, Michael and Alberta, gave him a different name from the one we know today. They called him Michael. But Michael Sr. later changed his name to Martin. He changed his son’s name too. They took the name Martin Luther, after the famous religious leader. Young Martin grew up in Atlanta, Georgia. His father and grandfather were pastors. The King children grew up in a loving home. But they experienced racism from an early age.
Separate but Never Equal
King attended public schools in Georgia. The schools were segregated at the time. King skipped grades 9 and 11 and graduated from high school at age 15. Around that time, he joined the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), a civil rights organization. 
In 1948, King graduated from Morehouse College, in Atlanta. He went on to study religion at Crozer  Seminary. The school was in Chester, Pennsylvania. He graduated in 1951. Soon after, he enrolled in a Ph.D. program at Boston University, in Massachusetts. He met music student Coretta Scott in Boston. The couple married in 1953. They later had two sons and two daughters.
Peaceful Protests
In 1954, King moved to Montgomery, Alabama. He became a pastor at the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church. Soon after, on December 1, 1955, Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat to a white passenger on a Montgomery city bus. She was arrested. In response, the NAACP led a citywide  against segregated buses. King was chosen to lead the boycott. 
For 381 days, black people refused to ride the buses. The boycott ended on December 21, 1956. That was after a decision by the U.S. Supreme Court. The court ruled that all people had equal rights to seats on buses. It was a key victory for civil rights. Eight years later, the Civil Rights Act outlawed racial discrimination in all public places.

“I Have a Dream”
In the spring of 1963, King organized a protest in Birmingham, Alabama. The city police blasted protesters with fire hoses. They let attack dogs loose. King and others were jailed. People across the nation heard about the event. 
After their release, King laid out plans for a march on the nation’s capital. The March on Washington attracted more than 250,000 people. On August 28, 1963, King gave his “I Have a Dream” speech. He did so at the Lincoln Memorial. In his address, he spoke of a day when all people would be treated equally. King went on to win the 1964 Nobel Peace Prize. He was 35 years old. He was also the youngest person to have received the honor. 
The Promised Land
The fight for equal rights, however, was far from over. On March 7, 1965, King organized a march from Selma to Montgomery, in Alabama. Police used nightsticks and tear gas on protesters. Seventeen people were hospitalized. Soon after, President Lyndon Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The law stated that all citizens had a right to vote. It said they could not be  against because of the color of their skin. 
On April 3, 1968, King attended a labor strike in Memphis, Tennessee. He told supporters, “I want you to know tonight, that we, as a people, will get to the Promised Land.” The next day, he was struck by a bullet. The shot ended King’s life. He was 39 years old. The accused shooter, James Earl Ray, pleaded guilty. He was sentenced to 99 years in prison. 
King’s birthday is observed as a national holiday on the third Monday in January. On that day, Americans honor the civil rights leader’s service and commitment.

676,676,Ruby Bridges,"{'TFK Library', 'History'}","
In 1960, Ruby Bridges (September 8, 1954—) walked through the doors of William Frantz Elementary School, in New Orleans, Louisiana. By doing so, she became the first African-American student to attend an all-white elementary school in the Southern United States. 
On November 14, 1960, Ruby Bridges became a symbol of the U.S. civil rights movement. She was just 6 years old. This marked the beginning of integration for U.S. public schools. 
Bridges was born in Tylertown, Mississippi, on September 8, 1954. A few months before, the Supreme Court had issued a ruling on five combined cases. The court’s decision would impact Bridges’s life and change American history. 
Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas aimed to end the idea of “separate but equal schools.” In many states, black students and white students could not attend the same school. On May 17, 1954, the Supreme Court ruled that segregation in U.S. public schools was against the Constitution.
Although it was illegal for schools to separate students by race, some states—especially in the South—did not follow the ruling. Five years after the Brown decision, little Ruby would become the first student to integrate a Southern elementary school.

A Promising Student
When Bridges was 4, her family moved from Mississippi to New Orleans, Louisiana. Her parents hoped a new city would offer better jobs. Her father, Abon, found a job working at a gas station. Her mother, Lucille, worked nights to help support the family.
Bridges attended kindergarten at a segregated school in New Orleans. But in 1960, a federal court ordered that Louisiana  all of its public schools. Bridges was a good student. She was chosen to be part of a small group of black students who would take a test given by the school district. The test determined which students would attend the all-white schools. Bridges was one of six black children who passed the test. She enrolled in William Frantz Elementary School. It was just blocks from her home.
At first, Bridges’s father did not want to enroll his daughter in the all-white school. He was afraid angry people would harm his family. However, her mother convinced him that it was the right decision. She believed their daughter would get a better education at an all-white school. Bridges’s parents, who could not read or write, wanted her to succeed. On November 14, federal marshals escorted Bridges and her mother to Ruby’s new school.
School of One
In a 1997 television interview, Bridges remembered preparing to leave for her first day at the school. She remembered looking out the window of a car driven by a U.S. marshal. “Driving up, I could see the crowd,” she said. “But living in New Orleans, I actually thought it was Mardi Gras.” 
An angry crowd had gathered outside the school before Bridges arrived. They chanted, “Two, four, six, eight, we don’t want to integrate!” They tried to block the entrance to the school. While Bridges and her mother sat in the principal’s office, hundreds of parents entered the school and removed their children from classrooms
.The next day, Bridges was led past the screaming crowd and into the school by four marshals. When she arrived at her classroom, she found a teacher but no students. Her teacher, Barbara Henry, from Boston, Massachusetts, had moved to the South hoping to help schools integrate. She was the only teacher willing to teach Bridges. “She would greet me, take me to my classroom, and it was just her and I,” said Bridges. Although Bridges and Henry remained in the classroom alone for the rest of the school year, neither missed a single day of class.
A Lasting Legacy
The following school year, Bridges attended second grade at William Frantz. This time, the crowds had disappeared, and her classroom was full of students. In 1999, Bridges created the Ruby Bridges Foundation to teach tolerance to students. The following year, she was made an honorary deputy federal marshal in Washington, D.C. “I am so proud to have received such an honor,” she said. “Deputy U.S. marshals are peacemakers and advocates of justice.” Today, Bridges is an author, activist, and public speaker. She continues her work helping people learn to be more accepting of others.

677,677,TFK Reads: My Life as an Ice Cream Sandwich,"{'Books', 'Time Off'}","
The main character in My Life as an Ice Cream Sandwich is named Ebony-Grace Norfleet Freeman. But in the imaginary world she’s created in her mind, she goes by E-Grace Starfleet.
My Life as an Ice Cream Sandwich, by Ibi Zoboi, is one of TFK’s recommended books from 2019. After we made our picks, we handed them off to our team of TFK Kid Reporters. Here, TFK Kid Reporter Henry Carroll shares his review.
This is the 10th and final book review in the series. We hope you’ve had a wonderful year, filled with great reading. We’ll be back with more book coverage in 2020.

Ebony-Grace, from Alabama, is spending the summer before seventh grade with her father, in Harlem, a neighborhood in New York City. She’s struggling to make friends there. So Ebony-Grace retreats into her favorite pastime, pretending to be a space explorer in an imaginary world she has created with her grandfather, a former NASA engineer. This only makes it harder for her to meet new people. But adjusting to life in Harlem is made a little easier when Ebony-Grace begins to find connections between her imaginary world and the movement of the city.
The characters in My Life as an Ice Cream Sandwich are very believable. They could be real kids. They are often mean, taking pleasure in excluding others from their group. The book would appeal to readers who like a realistic story with elements of fantasy.
I would not have chosen this book had I seen it in a bookstore. But I’m glad I read it. Ibi Zoboi has crafted a well-paced and engaging story, with the occasional comic strip that gives us a glimpse into Ebony-Grace’s imagination.

678,678,Trump Impeached,"{'United States', 'Government'}","
The U.S. House of Representatives voted last night to impeach President Donald Trump. To impeach a president means to charge him or her with a crime. A trial in the Senate will now decide whether he is guilty or innocent. Trump is the third president in U.S. history to be impeached.
House charges say Trump abused the power of his office, then tried to obstruct, or block, Congress from investigating his actions. The House began to look into Trump’s actions after an anonymous complaint was filed in August. It said President Trump pressured Ukraine to interfere in the 2020 U.S. presidential election.
Wednesday’s vote to impeach the president was largely along party lines. In other words, most House members in the Democratic Party voted for impeachment. Most House members in the Republican party voted against it. The final vote was 230–197.
Impeachment does not mean a president is removed from office. That is for the U.S. Senate to decide. Now that the president has been charged, a trial is expected to take place in the Senate early next year. There, House Democrats will make their case for why the president should be removed. Sixty-seven of the Senate’s 100 lawmakers must vote to do so. But that is unlikely to happen. Republicans have a majority in the Senate. They are expected to support President Trump, who is a Republican.
Trump was elected on November 8, 2016. He took office on January 20, 2017. He says he has done nothing wrong and intends to run for reelection in 2020.

Free Lunch is one of TFK’s recommended books from 2019. After we made our picks, we handed them off to our team of TFK Kid Reporters. Here, TFK Kid Reporter Priscilla Ho shares her review.
We’ll be posting more reviews throughout winter break. Check back on Monday to read about Pavi Sharma’s Guide to Going Home, by Bridget Farr.

In Free Lunch, author Rex Ogle tells the true story of his turbulent sixth-grade year. His mother and her boyfriend can’t find jobs and are often not home, leaving Rex to take care of his little brother, Ford. At school, Rex is in the free-lunch program, but he doesn’t want the rich kids to know. He feels ashamed.
This book takes a very honest look at poverty and what happens when kids have to fend for themselves. The characters feel super real. Rex does not sugarcoat any of his feelings.
For readers who have experienced poverty, Free Lunch will let them know they are not alone. Those who haven’t will feel compassion for Rex and his brother. I also think every politician should read this book.

More than half a million votes were cast in the 2019 TIME for Kids Person of the Year poll. Read on to learn about the winner and to see who came in second and third place.
First Place: José Andrés

COOKING UP CHANGE The votes are in! TIME for Kids readers have chosen chef José Andrés as the winner of the 2019 TFK Person of the Year poll.
Andrés founded World Central Kitchen (WCK), a  group that has provided millions of meals to the survivors of disasters and other emergencies. He believes a good meal can change the world.
Most disaster-relief agencies focus on delivering the basics. Often, they give out prepackaged food. But as a world-class chef, Andrés does things differently. WCK meals are fresh and tasty. When TFK interviewed Andrés for an October cover story, he explained why: “A hot meal represents love.”
In September, Andrés and his team sprang into action when the Bahamas were  by Hurricane Dorian. It was the strongest storm to ever hit the islands. To date, WCK has served more than 2 million meals there.
In October, when wildfires rocked California, WCK was on the ground just 36 hours later. The team served people who were forced to  their homes as well as firefighters battling the blazes.
Andrés’s current effort is in Albania. A major earthquake hit the European country in November. WCK is feeding people whose homes were destroyed. —By Shay Maunz

Allies is one of TFK’s recommended books from 2019. After we made our picks, we handed them off to our team of TFK Kid Reporters. Here, TFK Kid Reporter Jack Doane shares his review.
We’ll be posting more book reviews throughout winter break. Check back on Monday to read about The Big Book of Monsters, by Hal Johnson.

Allies is a work of historical fiction that takes place during World War II. Author Alan Gratz centers the story on a group of six characters. They are all involved with the D-Day invasion, which took place on June 6, 1944. On this day, Allied forces fought to free Europe from the Nazis. It was the largest military invasion in history.
The six characters involved in the invasion include a young soldier, a paratrooper, a spy working to sabotage the German army, a tank operator, and a medic. They come from different parts of the world. But they all play an important role in the invasion and must try their best to succeed.
I would rate Allies a 9 out of 10. The characters are extremely realistic, and readers can see themselves reflected in them. The reader feels every little victory against the Nazis, and is constantly cheering the characters on. Allies is an emotional roller coaster that kids will enjoy.

686,686,Impeachment Update,"{'United States', 'Government'}","
Nancy Pelosi made a big announcement on December 5. She said the U.S. House of Representatives will begin writing a document called the “articles of impeachment” against President Donald Trump. “The president’s actions have clearly violated the Constitution,” Pelosi says.
In September, the House began looking into a complaint. The complaint said Trump pressured Ukraine to interfere in the 2020 U.S. presidential election. The House interviewed officials who worked for Trump. Then House Democrats released a report. It says Trump “placed his own personal and political interests above the national interests.”
House Republicans disagree. They say the president did nothing wrong. Stephanie Grisham is the White House press secretary. “The Democrats should be ashamed,” she wrote on Twitter.
The House will likely vote to impeach, or charge Trump with a crime. A trial would then take place in the Senate. It would decide if the president should be removed from office.

ArcelorMittal Orbit
London, United Kingdom
Think art’s not exciting? The monumental ArcelorMittal Orbit sculpture, at Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, in London, will change that. The 376-foot-tall sculpture was created by artist Anish Kapoor and engineer Cecil Balmond. It’s wrapped in a serpentine, 584-foot tunnel slide designed by artist Carsten Höller. It’s the longest and tallest tunnel slide in the world. Riders strap on a helmet and hurtle through 12 hairpin turns. The ride ends with a corkscrew portion named after the German word for bedspring. Along the way, riders catch glimpses of the London skyline through the slide’s transparent sections. If this 40 seconds of hair-raising fun doesn’t get your adrenaline going, nothing will. —Brian S. McGrath


Artists at Play
Seattle, Washington
Artists at Play is a playground with a creative spirit. This imaginative space is located at the Seattle Center. It was designed by artists from the Pacific Northwest, with input from local kids. The result includes many traditional playground features—but with a twist. There’s a 38-foot-long curly slide, an ADA-accessible, human-powered carousel, and a song fence that looks like a giant pan flute. There’s also a 30-foot climbing tower, as well as a labyrinth that leads to a bronze rebus, where kids can practice their riddle-cracking skills. —Karena Phan


Canada’s Wonderland
Vaughan, Canada
When Yukon Striker opened at Canada’s Wonderland in May 2019, it was the fastest and longest dive roller coaster in the world. Riders pause for a queasy three seconds over a 90-degree drop. Then they fall 245 feet into an underwater tunnel, reaching speeds of 81 miles per hour. The ride was inspired by the Canadian gold rush of the 1890s. Adventurers braved rough terrain in search of the precious metal hidden in the Yukon Territory. Grace Peacock works for Canada’s Wonderland. She says the park is keeping that spirit alive. “We like to keep the thrills going,” she says. “And I tend to find that the kids are braver than the adults on these rides.” —Ellen Nam


City Museum
St. Louis, Missouri
City Museum is housed in a sprawling, 10-story, 600,000-square-foot former shoe warehouse. A school bus dangles from the building’s roof. The ultimate jungle gym extends from the windows. And that’s just where the magic begins. Inside City Museum are dark caves, crashing waters, and secret passageways—plus all the ramps, domes, tunnels, chutes, and slides a kid could want. Most of City Museum’s attractions are made of recycled materials. “City Museum is an evolving sculpture,” says general manager Rick Erwin. “It’s like the world’s largest playground.” —Rebecca Katzman


CopenHill
Copenhagen, Denmark 
CopenHill is a clean power plant that creates energy by burning waste instead of fossil fuels. But the facility, which opened in October, has something else that makes it special: It does its part to make sustainable living fun. The roof features a public park and a recreation center that includes the world’s tallest artificial climbing wall, a hiking trail, gardens, and a 1,300-foot artificial ski slope. The slope is designed to provide the sensation of skiing. But it doesn’t rely on cold temperatures or machine-made snow. That means visitors can enjoy year-round, Earth-friendly fun. —Rebecca Katzman 


Escape
Penang, Malaysia
Nature and thrills meet face-to-face at Escape, an unconventional theme park in the forests of Malaysia. Escape champions a low-tech, high-energy form of play. Climbing trees, launching yourself from branches, and jumping into rivers are part of the fun. One popular attraction is Monkey Business. It’s a rope course filled with obstacles and zip lines. Banana Flip is a waterslide that launches riders high into the air. Escape recently completed construction on the world’s largest waterslide. It takes ""four minutes to ride all the way through the trees and monkeys to the very bottom,” says sales-and-marketing executive Yang Yang. Also impressive: The slide was built without heavy machinery, so construction wouldn't harm wildlife. —Rebecca Katzman


Evermore Park
Pleasant Grove, Utah
Walk into a fantasy world and choose your own adventure at Evermore, an immersive-experience theme park. The park resembles an old European village. It gives visitors a chance to meet all kinds of characters, including elves, mages, and faeries. Every season there’s a new theme based on a different Evermore myth. That means there’s always something new to discover. Go on scavenger hunts, complete quests, and take on challenges such as archery or ax throwing. “Everyone experiences and plays Evermore differently,” said Ken Bretschneider. He’s the park’s CEO and founder. “Our goal is to create these fantastical stories you get to fully step into and be fully immersed in.” —Karena Phan 


Lego House 
Billund, Denmark
From the outside, the 130,000-square-foot Lego House looks like a large-scale version of a kid’s creation. Inside, visitors can explore everything the classic toys can do. The experience begins at the Tree of Creativity, which was crafted using more than 6 million bricks. It’s one of the largest Lego structures ever built. At the 6 Bricks Factory, guests collect a pack of a half dozen Legos that were made on-site. Each set shows visitors one of the more than 915 million possible ways those six bricks can be combined. —Constance Gibbs


Music Box Village
New Orleans, Louisiana
Music Box Village is a collection of small musical houses created by New Orleans artists. When visitors interact with the houses, the structures let out whistles, groans, hums, grunts, chirps, and other sounds. The results are part symphony, part cacophony. A recent addition comes from deaf artist Christine Sun Kim. She helped create Elevator Pitch, which was inspired by a game she played with her deaf friends as a child. Inside an elevator, they screamed at the top of their voices, loud enough to feel the vibrations. Inside Elevator Pitch, visitors are invited to press a button. When they do, they can feel the powerful vibrations created by deaf people’s voices. —Rebecca Mordechai


Oasis of the Seas
Cruise ship
Oasis of the Seas, from Royal Caribbean International, is one of the largest cruise ships in the world. The vessel launched about a decade ago. But in 2019, it underwent a massive, $165-million renovation. In November, the revamped Oasis set sail in the Caribbean. The ship is so huge it’s broken into seven neighborhoods. One of these, the Youth Zone, is just for kids. On board the ship, kids have their pick of activities. These include laser tag, an escape room, and a giant slide called the Ultimate Abyss. This 10-story thriller is the tallest slide on the high seas. —Ellen Nam


Otherworld
Columbus, Ohio
Otherworld is an art installation built by more than 40 artists. They filled a 32,000-square-foot facility with large-scale works, secret passages, and playgrounds that blur the line between virtual and digital. Each of Otherworld’s 47 rooms is designed to resemble a science-fiction fantasyland. Visitors are encouraged to explore freely. Kids can fill in magical coloring books and solve puzzles. Those who are feeling adventurous can crawl into the mouth of a giant fuzzy monster. “We want young readers to look at the world and think of new and fun ways to use the things they see,” operations director John Umland says. —Ellen Nam


Pacific Wheel at Pacific Park
Santa Monica, California
Santa Monica Pier is a well-known destination. “It has been featured in more than a thousand different movies, TV shows, and music videos,” says Nathan Smithson, who works at the pier. The Pacific Park amusement complex features classic rides and games. But the park’s centerpiece has a futuristic twist: It’s the world’s only solar-powered Ferris wheel. The eco-friendly attraction uses LED lighting. It’s more energy-efficient than the bulbs used on traditional wheels. And the structure itself is powered by the sun. That means the ride—which carries you up nine stories, until you’re hanging some 130 feet above the Pacific Ocean—comes with minimal environmental impact. —Karena Phan


Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge at Walt Disney World 
Orlando, Florida
Visiting Disney World's new Star Wars attraction is like entering a galaxy far, far away. Galaxy's Edge opened in 2019 at Disney's Hollywood studios. Aspiring Jedi build their own lightsabers to prepare for battle. Then they blast off in the Millennium Falcon to embark on an interactive smuggling operation. When the mission is complete, they can refuel with Luke Skywalker’s favorite drink, blue milk, before stopping at the Droid Depot. There, they can customize their own droid friend to take along when they return to their home planet. —Constance Gibbs


The Dr. Seuss Experience
Canada and the United States
Dr. Seuss stories come to life at the Dr. Seuss Experience. This traveling 15,000-square-foot installation transforms the beloved author’s books into an interactive adventure. Susan Brandt is the president of Dr. Seuss Enterprises. She says the project “introduces kids to the Dr. Seuss world in a new and unique way.” Visitors can walk through a balloon-filled maze inspired by Oh, the Places You’ll Go!, wander among Truffula Trees from The Lorax, and take a ride on a Seuss-themed carousel. The Dr. Seuss Experience kicked off in the fall, in Toronto, Canada. It will travel to multiple cities across the United States. —Rebecca Mordechai 


Gathering Place
Tulsa, Oklahoma 
Historically, Tulsa, Oklahoma, has struggled with inequality. Local philanthropist George B. Kaiser wanted to help fix that. His approach: to help fund the creation of a $465 million park on the city’s waterfront. Gathering Place opened in 2018. It’s free and open to the public, and it was designed to bring the people of Tulsa together. The park features a BMX track, a skate park, a pond, and public art exhibits. There’s also a five-acre adventure playground, complete with climbing towers, a water feature so impressive it’s called Charlie’s Water Mountain, and a sensory garden that encourages visitors to experience the park using all five senses. “Play is universal,” says executive director Tony Moore. “It doesn’t matter the color of your skin.” —Shay Maunz


The original version of this story misstated how far along Escape was in building the world's largest waterslide. The theme park recently completed construction on the waterslide, they are not in the process of building it.

Apollo Mission Control Center at NASA’s Johnson Space Center
Houston, Texas
Astronauts get all the glory, but true STEM geeks know the people at mission control are superstars, too. Don’t believe us? Take a tour of the Apollo Mission Control Center. In 1985, the room was designated a National Historic Landmark. Work began in 2017 to restore it to perfect condition. And now you can visit to experience the magic of the Apollo missions firsthand. Learn about the engineers, flight controllers, and scientists who worked behind the scenes to make the moon landing a reality. The team at the center hosts events every day of the year, for kids as young as 4. “You can be a part of the mission at any age,” education manager James Wigfall says. —Allison Singer


Biblo Tøyen
Oslo, Norway
Libraries are special places where kids can read, learn, and create. Deichman Biblo Tøyen is one of the coolest of them all. This striking library for children ages 10 to 15 was designed to inspire. With many colorful exhibits and surprises, each section offers visitors an interactive experience. For those who have come just to cuddle up with a good book, there are plenty of comfy spots to do so. Grab a seat in a pillow-packed wheelbarrow, a vintage pickup truck, or a repurposed ski lift. Or plop down into a simple chair or cushion. The best part? This library is just for kids—no adults allowed! —Allison Singer


Children’s Museum of Indianapolis
Indianapolis, Indiana
There are many children’s museums, but none are quite as amazing—or as expansive—as the Children’s Museum of Indianapolis. After all, it’s the largest children’s museum in the world. Here, kids can learn about dinosaurs, ancient Greece, outer-space artifacts, and much more. In 2018, the museum opened the Riley Children’s Health Sports Legends Experience. It’s a 7.5-acre space where kids can play while learning about the history and culture of sports. Experts are on hand to coach young athletes. They can help them use their newfound skills in football, basketball, hockey, golf, car racing, and other sports. Kids can also sculpt their own sports figures or record a TV-ready sports broadcast. —Rebecca Katzman


Farm Wisconsin Discovery Center
Manitowoc, Wisconsin
Where did your breakfast come from? There’s a good chance at least some of it originated in Wisconsin. The state is one of America’s top producers of milk and cheese. Since it opened in 2018, Farm Wisconsin Discovery Center has helped visitors understand and appreciate the food on their tables. Its special ingredient is a partnership with nearby Grotegut Dairy Farm, which bridges the gap between museum and real-world dairy operation. Visitors can take a bus tour of the farm to see it in action. And when any of Grotegut’s 2,500 cows is ready to have a baby, it is brought to Farm Wisconsin’s birthing center. There, the animal has its newborn in a safe, clean environment—and visitors are able to watch it all. There’s no guarantee a birth will happen during your visit, but the odds are pretty good. In Farm Wisconsin’s first year, more than 250 calves were born. —Shay Maunz


ImagiNations Activity Center at the Smithsonian National Museum of the American Indian
Washington, D.C.
What do suspension bridges, rubber, and chocolate have in common? Their early histories all go back to the Native people of North and South America. At the ImagiNations Activity Center, visitors can learn about these innovations and many others. The center is part of the Smithsonian National Museum of the American Indian. Visitors can sit inside a full-sized Comanche tepee or learn how to build an igloo. They can also explore methods of transportation that were pioneered by Native people, such as snowshoes and skateboards. “This space is a great place to come and be introduced to Native culture,” says Adrienne L. Smith. She’s the center’s manager, and a member of the Muscogee (Creek) and Cherokee Nations of Oklahoma. Smith says visitors can learn about the past, “but also look at how we’re continuing our culture today.” —Karena Phan


La Brea Tar Pits
Los Angeles, California
Did you know that people can discover fossils in a major city? Head to the La Brea Tar Pits to see an active dig site in the heart of Los Angeles. The tar pits were formed thousands of years ago, from natural sticky asphalt. The asphalt trapped animals, plants, and insects during the Ice Age. Scientists and researchers have been excavating for more than a hundred years. Artifacts are still being found there, including fossils from dire wolves and saber-toothed cats. Anyone can visit the tar pits, learn about the discoveries made there, and watch paleontologists at work finding and studying fossils. —Karena Phan


Louisville Slugger Museum & Factory 
Louisville, Kentucky 
The first thing you’ll notice at the Louisville Slugger Museum & Factory is the Big Bat. It’s a 120-foot-tall steel replica of a bat used by Babe Ruth. Step inside the museum to find the Big Glove, a climbable work of art carved from 450-million-year-old Kentucky limestone. Other hands-on experiences include a batting cage and a chance to pose with actual bats used by star players, including Derek Jeter. Not a baseball fan? “No worries, we’ve got you covered,” executive director Anne Jewell says. She recommends the factory tour. “You walk right through the heart of our production line.” —Jaime Joyce


Moat Brae
Dumfries, United Kingdom
“Moat Brae is a very special place,” says Catherine Colwell, who works in programming at the town house. J.M. Barrie, author of Peter Pan, agreed. During his childhood in the 1870s, Barrie played pirate-adventure games in the garden and woods surrounding the property. Decades later, these games inspired him as he wrote his classic story. In 2019, Moat Brae reopened as Scotland’s National Centre for Children’s Literature and Storytelling. Kids can run through the building’s enchanted gardens, enjoy the Lost Boys’ tree house, and board a full-scale pirate ship. Indoors, they can search for hidden messages scattered around the house or look for Peter Pan’s shadow. “It gives anyone, no matter their age, the freedom to explore their own imagination,” Colwell says. —Ellen Nam


National Butterfly Center
Mission, Texas
The National Butterfly Center is a dream come true for butterfly lovers. Picture more than 200 species flying free across 100 acres of gardens, woodlands, and nature trails. Butterflies are drawn to the property by nectar plants. The plants produce the sweet syrup that butterflies rely on for food. Some of the insects, such as the ruby-spotted swallowtail, are found almost exclusively in this part of the U.S. Others, like the world-famous monarch, are just migrating through. Texas is located between the main breeding ground for monarchs, in the northern U.S., and the warmer climate of Mexico, where they spend their winters. —Allison Singer


Notre-Dame Cathedral
Paris, France
Notre-Dame is one of the world’s most famous landmarks. When a fire tore through the Roman Catholic cathedral on April 15, 2019, people around the globe came together to raise money for its restoration. “The cathedral is more than the building itself,” says Michel Picaud, head of the charity Friends of Notre-Dame de Paris. “It’s a part of the worldwide culture.” Even while it’s under repair, Notre-Dame is worth seeing. It’s one of the finest examples of Gothic architecture ever constructed. Think towering arches, creepy gargoyles, flying buttresses, and beautiful stained-glass windows. The cathedral is also home to countless historical artifacts and works of art. —Rebecca Katzman


Statue of Liberty Museum
Liberty Island, New York
What does liberty mean? Find out at the Statue of Liberty Museum, which opened in May. Kids can learn the rich history of this 133-year-old structure, including what the iconic statue represents to the country and the world. Take interactive tours, explore smaller statues made from Legos and other materials, and even climb a replica of Lady Liberty’s feet. The museum is also home to the original torch and numerous artifacts. “Many people have a special connection to the statue,” Liberty Island park ranger Bryanna Plog says. “She is the symbol of many things, such as liberty and freedom.” —Ellen Nam


U.S. Space & Rocket Center 
Huntsville, Alabama
Want to learn what it’s like to travel into space? The U.S. Space & Rocket Center takes you as close as you can get without leaving Earth’s atmosphere. Visitors get a taste of astronaut life through flight simulation experiences, such as the G-Force Accelerator and a rocket-launch simulator. As the home of Space Camp, the Aviation Challenge, and Robotics Camp, the center is also a training ground for budding astronauts. Outside the museum stands the world’s only full-scale display of a Space Transportation System: a massive space shuttle, complete with rocket boosters. —Rebecca Katzman


Washington Monument
Washington, D.C.
At the western end of the National Mall, the Washington Monument towers over our country’s capital. The 555-foot obelisk—a four-sided stone pillar with a pyramid-shaped top—was built to honor the first U.S. president, George Washington. For most of the last eight years, visitors have only been able to view it from afar. It has been closed to the public. But in September, the monument reopened with an upgraded elevator system. Back in 1886, when the public was first allowed inside, guests had to climb nearly 900 steps to the top. Today, the 500,000 or so yearly visitors can take a 70-second ride to the observation deck.“It’s still a thrill to go up there and see these iconic national memorials in the distance,” says National Parks Service spokesman Mike Litterst. Those who make the trip can spot the White House; the Lincoln, Jefferson, and Martin Luther King Jr. Memorials; and the U.S. Capitol. “It’s the highest point in the city,” Litterst says. “It gives you an unobstructed view of American history.” —Brian S. McGrath


Woodland Park Zoo
Seattle, Washington
The Woodland Park Zoo is a leader among immersive wildlife exhibits. Visitors can stroll African grassland as lions warm themselves on the rocks. Or they can wander through a humid tropical rain forest under the watchful eyes of gorillas. The zoo is home to more than 1,100 animals and 300 species. All of them inhabit areas that carefully recreate their natural ecosystems. Dave Wilke is the zoo’s facilities director. He hopes that visitors gain an appreciation for the variety of life that shares our planet. “Visiting the zoo is an opportunity to have a firsthand experience with something significantly different and bigger than us,” he says. —Brian S.

Best Friends Animal Sanctuary
Kanab, Utah
The Best Friends Animal Sanctuary is the nation’s largest no-kill sanctuary for companion animals. The former ranch is located on 20,000 acres of land in the canyons of southern Utah. On any given day, it’s home to some 1,600 homeless animals. Many of them are adoptable. The sanctuary also welcomes human visitors. Volunteers can let a dog stretch its legs by taking it on a nature hike. Or they can give a cat some fresh air by pushing it around the property in a buggy. They can chat with the birds of Parrot Garden, watch rabbits hop around the Bunny House, and visit the residents of Horse Haven. Volunteers often form a special bond with an animal. In that case, they’re able to take the creature away overnight, to see if it’s a good fit for adoption. —Shay Maunz 


Boulders Beach
Simon’s Town, South Africa
Boulders Beach, just outside of Cape Town, is no ordinary stretch of sand. In the early 1980s, a colony of African penguins settled there. Since then, the penguin population has grown to between 2,000 and 3,000. Each year, they’re joined by some 60,000 humans who visit the beach to hang out with the well-dressed birds. Three wheelchair-friendly boardwalks at nearby Foxy Beach provide spots where visitors can view the penguins from afar. For an especially great photo op, try going in the morning or late afternoon. That’s when the colony is most active. —Rebecca Mordechai


Cherry Springs State Park
Coudersport, Pennsylvania
Can’t see the stars where you live? Try Cherry Springs State Park. It has been designated one of the best places for stargazing in the eastern U.S. by the International Dark-Sky Association. The 82-acre park is surrounded by a sparsely populated forest. Hilltops block light pollution emitted by urban centers in nearby valleys. This lack of light pollution is what makes the park’s exceptionally dark skies possible. What celestial sights might you see in Cherry Springs? Meteor showers, asteroids, and the glow of the Milky Way, to name a few. —Rebecca Mordechai


Children’s Eternal Rainforest
Monteverde, Costa Rica
The Children’s Eternal Rainforest, or Bosque Eterno de los Niños, is a 55,000-acre private nature reserve in Costa Rica. In 1987, a group of Swedish schoolchildren learned about the rain forest. They were inspired to help preserve it. Together, they raised enough money to purchase 15 acres of land. The group soon organized a worldwide fundraising campaign. Children donated a total of $2 million to buy even more land. Now visitors can enjoy the nature reserve by going on a hiking tour. Along the way, they may spot rain-forest animals such as toucans and white-faced monkeys. —Constance Gibbs


Cliff Palace at Mesa Verde National Park 
Mesa Verde, Colorado
Go back in time at Mesa Verde National Park. The park protects nearly 5,000 archaeological sites, preserving the heritage of the ancestral Pueblo people. The Pueblo settled in the region about 1,400 years ago and built cliff dwellings using sandstone and wooden beams. Mesa Verde is home to the Cliff Palace. It’s the largest such dwelling in North America. The Cliff Palace has 150 rooms and was once home to more than 100 people. Today, visitors can join a park ranger for a guided tour of the structure. —Rebecca Mordechai


Denali Star 
Alaska 
The Denali Star leaves Anchorage, Alaska, every summer morning. It makes three stops as it travels north for 356 miles, or 12 hours, until it reaches Fairbanks. It passes wetlands, forests, mountains, canyons, and glaciers. On a clear day, passengers can spot the peak of Denali, the tallest mountain in North America. The route covers territory that isn’t easily accessible any other way. “You’re off the beaten track, seeing a lot of things that people just don’t get to see from the road,” says Tim Sullivan Jr. of Alaska Railroad. Plus, for much of the trip, there’s no cell-phone service, forcing passengers to unplug and enjoy the ride. —Shay Maunz


Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve
Mosca, Colorado
Want to hit the slopes during the summer? Try Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve. These 750-foot dunes—the tallest in the U.S.—are the perfect place for sandboarding and sand sledding. When the afternoon sand heats up, head down to Medano Creek, where mountain snowmelt creates a natural beach for swimming and building sandcastles. Plan to be in the park at night, too. The air is so clear that you can see the Milky Way light up the sky. “This place is tailor-made for kids,” park ranger Patrick Myers says. “There really is a unique sense of uninhibited freedom here.” —Brian S. McGrath


Icehotel 
Jukkasjärvi, Sweden
At Icehotel, guests chill out in rooms made completely from ice and snow. “It’s like walking into a world of your dreams,” says Icehotel press and media manager Josefin Lindberg. “It’s like you’re in a fairy tale.” Artists from around the world come together each year to recreate the magical dwelling. To get the job done, they use more than 3,000 tons of ice from the nearby Torne River. The majority of the hotel melts each year when the weather grows warm. But Icehotel 365, which launched in 2016, lets visitors experience the wonderland all year long, at 23°F. In warmer months, it’s chilled using refrigeration that’s powered by solar panels. —Rebecca Katzman


Neuschwanstein Castle
Hohenschwangau, Germany
Neuschwanstein Castle is a fairy-tale destination for history lovers. If it looks like the castles in classic Disney parks and stories, that might be because Walt Disney visited Neuschwanstein before he built his amusement center in California. The German castle was constructed by order of King Ludwig II. But he didn’t get to live in his creation—he died before its 1892 completion. Outside, there are tall towers. Inside, there are beautiful paintings and murals. The throne hall holds a 13-foot chandelier (but never had a throne). Neuschwanstein means “new swan stone,” which explains the swan artwork throughout the castle. —Constance Gibbs


Niagara Falls State Park
Niagara Falls, New York
Niagara Falls is famous for its raging waterfalls. But since it opened in 1885, the state park has also been a place of quiet contemplation. Visitors wander nature trails and enjoy family picnics. With the completion of a $70 million renovation that includes new walkways, America’s oldest state park is more accessible than ever. “A family with a child with a disability can enjoy this park to the utmost,” says park ambassador Marc Touma. He adds that free entry and a $3 all-day trolley pass make the park affordable, too: “You could be here for very few dollars and have a great family day.” —Brian S. McGrath


The Grand Canyon
Arizona
The Grand Canyon stretches across 277 miles of northern Arizona. In some places, it is more than a mile deep. That’s about three times the height of New York City’s tallest building, One World Trade Center. “It is so massive, you cannot see all of it,” says park ranger Kari Cobb. “That’s what makes this place so intriguing.” In 2019, Grand Canyon National Park celebrates its centennial. That marks 100 years since the canyon was granted national-park status. Today, the Grand Canyon attracts some 6 million visitors each year. Skywalk, a glass-floored walkway jutting over a cliff’s edge, is a big draw for many of them. There, visitors can catch a glimpse of the Colorado River at the bottom of the canyon, flowing as it has for about 6 million years. —Brian S. McGrath 


The Lion King Adventure 
Kenya
The Safari Collection, a group of wildlife lodges across Kenya, has created a Lion King–themed adventure to celebrate the 2019 remake of the classic kids’ movie. The trip is led by Robert Carr-Hartley. He served as an adviser on the original 1994 film. He led a similar safari for that movie’s animators. Carr-Hartley played an important role in the story’s creation: He recommended that the screenplay include Simba’s warthog sidekick, Pumbaa. And he helped out with the Kenyan sayings, too—most importantly, for the song “Hakuna Matata.” This new safari is a tour of Kenya that highlights several real-world inspirations for the film. In Laikipia, you’ll be able to climb the actual Pride Rock. At Giraffe Manor, a hotel in Nairobi, you can meet Pumbaa’s warthog friends and a local herd of Rothschild’s giraffes. And in the Maasai Mara National Reserve, where wildlife thrives, you’ll spend the night in a tent. You just might wake up to hear a pride of lions roaring in the distance. —Constance Gibbs


The Vessel at Hudson Yards
New York, New York 
New York City has a new landmark. It’s called the Vessel, and it’s located at Hudson Yards. That’s a development of shops, residences, office buildings, and green spaces on the west side of Manhattan. The Vessel, which opened to the public in March 2019, is the centerpiece of it all. The honeycomb-like structure has 154 interconnecting flights of stairs and nearly 2,500 steps. As visitors climb the many staircases, they are rewarded with a series of unique city views from different angles and heights. —Rebecca Mordechai


Waitomo Glowworm Caves
Waitomo, New Zealand
The ancient caves in the village of Waitomo were first explored more than a century ago, by a Maori chief and a surveyor. Today, visitors can take a boat tour of the caverns’ lower level. Many of the tour guides are descendants of the chief who discovered the caves. As your boat floats through the grotto, look up at the magical sparkling lights. But look closely—these aren’t just any lights. They’re glowworms! Glowworms are the larvae of a type of gnat called Arachnocampa luminosa. The insect lives in New Zealand and, at this young stage, can grow as large as a matchstick. Its glow comes from its bioluminescent tail. —Karena Phan


Whispering Woods Braille Trail
Buford, Georgia 
Evan Barnard believes that all people should have access to nature. At age 14, he set out to create Whispering Woods, a Braille nature trail. The trail uses Braille signs and guide ropes. They help people who are blind or visually impaired explore nature without assistance. Visitors can enjoy a safe sensory experience by feeling the scratchy bark of a tree, hearing a bird’s song, or smelling the earthy odor of the woods. “It’s a transformative experience for many,” Barnard, now 21, says. —Rebecca Mordechai


Wyoming Dinosaur Center & Dig Sites
Thermopolis, Wyoming 
The Wyoming Dinosaur Center sits on the Morrison Formation, a huge deposit of rocks rich with prehistoric fossils. In fact, more than 10,000 bones have been found at the museum’s main dig site. Visitors can really get in on the excavation action. Kids can visit the dig sites, where they work with paleontologists to find dinosaur bones and other ancient discoveries. “We give kids the opportunity to work alongside us, to be a part of the science,” says education director Jessica Lippincott. Back inside the museum, they can join the staff to clean and examine their fossil finds. —Ellen Nam

PBJ.LA
Los Angeles, California 
These aren’t your grandmother’s peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwiches. PBJ.LA gives America’s classic lunch-box staple an innovative upgrade. Carefully curated combinations of nut butter and jam are served on circular bread. Then a crimper seals the sandwich and removes the crust. Don’t worry—all that excess crust doesn’t go to waste. It’s used to make cinnamon-and-sugar bites. All ingredients are plant-based, and nut butters, jams, and milks are made from scratch, with organic ingredients. “We’ve taken a popular American nostalgic idea, and we’ve made it global and cultural,” says cofounder Payvand Salehi. “We wanted to take PB&J back to its roots and make it clean and organic.” —Rebecca Katzman


Saint Pierre

Chef Emmanuel Stroobant believes fine dining shouldn’t be just for adults. Kids should enjoy the experience too. That’s why he offers a children’s menu at his restaurant Saint Pierre. In 2019, Saint Pierre was awarded two Michelin stars. A Michelin star is one of the most important honors in the world of gourmet food. The restaurant specializes in French cuisine with Asian-inspired touches. The children’s menu includes the same range of tastes—salty, sweet, sour, and bitter—that many grown-up menus offer. To keep the children’s menu fresh, Stroobant changes it every three to four months. And kids can even see how the chefs prepare their unique dishes. “All young guests at Saint Pierre are invited to pop into the kitchen,” Stroobant says. —Rebecca Mordechai


SafeHouse Milwaukee
Milwaukee, Wisconsin
Looking to sharpen your secret-agent skills? Spy-themed restaurant SafeHouse is the place to go. Since 1966, young spies in training have been visiting its Milwaukee location to learn the tricks of the trade. Junior agents begin their mission by cracking a password and entering the restaurant through a secret bookcase. Inside, they watch magicians and illusionists perform tricks, decode giant puzzles, and search for clues that can help them on a scavenger hunt. To complete their mission, spies rely on a phone booth to receive instructions for using an escape route. —Constance Gibbs


The Kinderkookkafé 
Amsterdam, the Netherlands
A child in Amsterdam doesn’t need to wait to grow up to realize his or her dream of becoming a chef. At the Kinderkookkafé, kids take charge of the restaurant. They set up the tables, cook the meals, and serve the food. There’s culinary fun for kids ages 2 to 12. With their parents’ help, the youngest visitors can put together their own desserts and pizzas. Older kids may choose to host a dinner party (imagine cooking a three-course meal for your birthday-party guests). Or they can have “high tea” with plenty of cakes, scones, and finger sandwiches to go around. —Allison Singer

Thirty minutes before the party, volunteers arrive. They hang a banner and streamers, set up games and activities, and arrange wrapped gifts on a table. Soon it’s time to blast the music and welcome the eager guests. Kids rush in, ready to celebrate. Happy Birthday!
Each month, these parties take place at homeless shelters and  living facilities. They’re hosted by the Birthday Party Project. The nonprofit organization throws parties for groups of kids who don’t have a permanent home. For some children, it’s the first birthday party they’ve ever had.

Let’s Celebrate
Paige Chenault is the founder of the Birthday Party Project. “A birthday is a perfect place and a perfect time in our life to stop and celebrate,” she told TIME for Kids. Chenault’s family threw the group’s first event in January 2012. It was at a shelter in Dallas, Texas. Now the Birthday Party Project hosts about 50 monthly parties in 15 cities. More than 10,000 kids have celebrated their birthday at these events. 
Dipson, 8, is one of them. He lives in a transitional housing community in Minneapolis, Minnesota. At a party there in March 2018, Dipson played ring toss. He also opened his presents: Hot Wheels and a new scooter. “It was very fun,” he says. But Dipson also says he learned a lesson from eating too many cupcakes: “You can get a little bit sick when you have too much chocolate,” he warns future partygoers.
Jamie Gates is a coordinator at the community where Dipson lives. The Birthday Party Project holds parties there on the third Thursday of each month. Gates says that if she doesn’t put up flyers for the next event at least five days in advance, kids will start asking about it. “They love it,” she says. “Parents will come to the party, too. It’s a really good opportunity for them to sit and talk, and for the entire place to come together.”

695,695,Remaking Money,"{'United States', 'Government'}","
Imagine you’ve been saving to buy a scooter. Then you make a shocking discovery. Your brother accidentally put your envelope of money through a paper shredder! Your cash is confetti.
Don’t panic. The U.S. government can replace your money. That’s according to Eric Walsh. He works for the Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP) in Washington, D.C. The BEP is the government office that prints paper money. Walsh works for its  Currency Division. His team figures out the value of damaged cash. The BEP reimburses people who send it in.
Last year, the BEP handled about 24,000 claims. They totaled more than $40 million. A claim can take anywhere from a few hours to three years to process. “It’s a painstaking job,” Walsh told TIME for Kids. “Some of the claims are giant jigsaw puzzles.”
Patience Pays Off
Each mutilated currency claim is handled by a single examiner. Cases are given a grade from 1 to 5. “Level 1 cases you can pretty much count by hand,” Walsh says. Level 5s? “They’re where someone buried currency in the yard for 20 years, and when they went to dig it up, it had .”
Water and fire are the most common causes of mutilated currency. Hurricanes and wildfire can lead to an increase in claims. “The toughest cases are the burnt ones,” says BEP examiner Tina Barnett. “The notes shrink and look like Monopoly money.”

To make sure a bill is real, examiners use a microscope to read its fine print. Special lights help them see a bill’s security features. Otherwise, the job is  “pretty low-tech,” Walsh says. “Examiners go through each note and piece it together by hand.” Often, they use nothing more than “a scalpel, some tape, some glue, maybe tweezers.”
The hard work is worth it. “For some of our customers, this is their life savings,” Walsh says. “So it’s very rewarding to be a bright spot in people’s lives.”

696,696,Fighting Food Ads,"{'Business', 'Food and Nutrition'}","
Food companies engineer junk food to make it addictive. They label their products to make them seem healthier than they are. And their advertisements target children.
This is what students in a Texas middle school learned. They were taking part in an experiment. “How is this even legal?” said a girl who took part in a similar study.
Researchers had students read news stories about how food companies advertise. They wanted to find out if this would change how kids feel about junk food. All over the world, kids are eating more foods high in salt, sugar, and fat. That is partly the result of clever ads.
Christopher J. Bryan of the University of Chicago led the study. He says questioning the  behind junk-food ads is like fighting . “The reward is knowing you’re doing the right thing,” Bryan told TIME for Kids.
Message Matters
Junk food has been linked to health problems, like obesity and diabetes. But in 2017, food companies spent some $9 billion on TV ads selling junk food.
An ad with cartoons can make cereal seem fun to eat. An athlete enjoying a sugary drink makes it look cool. Companies know that if kids want a product, they’ll bug their parents to buy it. Even parents don’t notice the power of ads, says Marion Nestle, a professor at New York University. “By the time you’re an adult, you’re used to junk-food ads,” she says.
In the Texas study, Bryan had students view ads on an iPad. Their job was to make each ad’s message true. They did this by writing on the screen. One ad showed a McDonald’s Big Mac. The message read: “The thing you want when you order salad.” To the end of the sentence, a student added “should be salad.”
The results of Bryan’s study were published in April. They showed that analyzing ads led students to choose healthier snacks. “They see themselves as agents in the world,” Bryan says. “They see a chance to make the world a better place.”

Cats is one of the longest-running stage musicals ever. The show follows a group of felines on a special night: the Jellicle Ball.
Now, Cats has been made into a movie. Professional dancer Robbie Fairchild plays Munkustrap. His character guides Victoria, a newcomer to the group. “It’s my job to show her our world,” Fairchild told TIME for Kids.
Dance is an important part of the movie’s “storytelling process,” Fairchild says. That’s why the cast researched cats. “We did a lot of work learning how they move,” he says, “and how their bodies are different than ours.”
According to Fairchild, Cats is the first movie to mix footage of the actors’ faces with computer-animated bodies. “They’re using high-tech equipment and software,” he says. 
Cats opens December 20.

699,699,Meet Stevie,"{'Health', 'Inventions'}","
It’s karaoke-rehearsal time at the Knollwood military  community, in Washington, D.C. Phil Soriano is 86. He has hosted the community’s sing-alongs since 2016. Today, he’ll share host duties with a special guest, one who has been at Knollwood for the past six weeks: Stevie.
Soriano wants to sing the song “Y.M.C.A.” while Stevie leads the crowd through the song’s dance moves. This will be difficult. Why? Stevie is a robot.

“We could try to make him dance,” says Niamh Donnelly. She’s Stevie’s lead  engineer. Donnelly types commands on a laptop. In response, the robot stretches its peg-like arms. A grin flashes on its  face.
Stevie was made by the Robotics and  Lab at Trinity College Dublin, in Ireland. Trinity researchers moved into Knollwood this year. They are trying to understand what people there might want from a robot.
At Your Service
Many different robots are used in health care. Some zip around hospitals like motorized carts. Doll-like robots bring patients comfort. Stevie is what’s known as a social robot. It’s designed to  with people. Stevie responds to words with speech and movements. For example, tell Stevie you’re sick, and it frowns and says, “I’m sorry to hear that.” Compliment Stevie, and its screen changes to a smile. At rest, its eyes blink. Stevie’s waiting for a command.

Stevie can answer about 100 questions, such as “How are you?” Otherwise, a person must type words for Stevie to say. At an event with Knollwood residents, Donnelly had Stevie tell a joke: “What did the left eye say to the right? Between you and me, something smells!”
Researchers guessed people would want Stevie to do chores, says Conor McGinn, Stevie’s lead engineer. But residents didn’t want to give Stevie an order and have it scoot away. They wanted Stevie to stay and keep them company.
According to McGinn, his team asked residents what they liked most about the robot. They said, “It made me smile.”
Jobs at Risk?
Some health-care workers are worried about Stevie. The monthly cost for the robot would be about half the cost of hiring a human to do the job. And unlike a human, a robot can be on its feet—well, its wheels—all day without getting tired. But Stevie’s creators say they don’t want to replace people. They want robots and humans to work together.
Menbere Gebral works at Knollwood. She’s an activities assistant there. Stevie came to her bingo hour. At first, Gebral was nervous. But after one game, she was glad. Stevie called out the numbers so Gebral could help people. Even with Stevie running the activity, Gebral was busy during bingo hour. And she was busy doing the part of her job that she likes best—interacting with residents. “It’s very helpful,” she says of Stevie.
And what about the karaoke concert? “Y.M.C.A.” was a hit. Stevie did the best dance it could. It wasn’t perfect, but that didn’t matter. The audience was happy.
Health Tech
Health care is quickly changing. That’s because of new medical inventions. No one can guess what the future will be. But here are three items that give us a glimpse of it.

3-D HEARTS HeartFlow makes digital models of hearts. Doctors use them to prepare for surgeries. The models can be zoomed into.
VR THERAPY After a spine injury, Isabel Van De Keere started a company. It’s called Immersive Rehab. It uses VR to help injured patients heal.
MIND-READING WATCH With the CTRL-kit watch, users play video games—using only their brain. The watch detects the brain’s electrical impulses.

700,700,Venice Floods,"{'Weather', 'World'}","
Officials in Venice, Italy, are working to fast-track a project to protect the city from floods. This comes after record flooding last month.
The trouble began on November 12. Venice had its highest tide in 50 years. The water came from the Adriatic Sea. Winds pushed the water . This caused severe flooding. The water reached more than six feet above sea level. That’s the second-highest level ever recorded in Venice.
The city had two more high tides later that week. They came on November 15 and 17. Each caused the water level to reach about five feet. Such levels are unusual in Venice. They have not been seen more than once in a single year since record-keeping began. The city began keeping records in 1872.
Giuseppe Conte is Italy’s . He called the flooding a “blow to the heart of our country.” Homes, businesses, and monuments were all overrun with water.
St. Mark’s Basilica flooded for only the sixth time in its history. It opened in 1094.

A tiny deerlike animal has been rediscovered in Vietnam. This is according to a paper published on November 11. The silver-backed chevrotain had not been seen since 1990. “For so long, this species has seemingly only existed as part of our imagination,” said An Nguyen. He’s a scientist with Global Wildlife Conservation (GWC).
The chevrotain is about the size of a rabbit. It’s also called a mouse-deer. But it’s not a mouse. And it’s not a deer. It’s the world’s smallest ungulate. That’s an animal with hooves.
The species was thought to be lost forever to poaching and deforestation. Since confirming that the animal still exists, GWC is making a plan to save it. “We’re moving quickly to figure out how best to protect it,” Nguyen said.

“Hello, crochet friends!” That’s how Jonah Larson, 11, starts his popular online crochet videos. Jonah lives in La Crosse, Wisconsin. He’s been crocheting since he was 5. Crocheting involves looping yarn with a hooked needle. This makes a fabric.
How did Jonah get interested in crochet? “It all started when I found a hooked needle in my aunt’s bag of crafts,” he told TIME for Kids. Jonah began watching how-to-crochet videos online. He had a talent for crocheting  designs. Soon, he was crafting a blanket with 800 crocheted flowers.
With his parents’ help, Jonah opened an Instagram account to show off his creations. He also started a business to sell his work. He called it Jonah’s Hands. Jonah’s Hands got the attention of the La Crosse Tribune. The newspaper published a story about Jonah this year. He got about 4,500 orders after that.
Crafting a Business
Jonah couldn’t keep up with the demand for his work. His main job is school. And as Jonah says, “I only have two hands!” So he found other ways to do business. Jonah now works with yarn companies to make videos. He also partners with stores to design clothing.
Jonah says it’s important to “get support from other people.” He counts on Daniel Sheehan. Sheehan is a fashion designer. He  Jonah. What’s Sheehan’s advice for starting a business? “Get your ideas on paper,” he says, “so you can better communicate your business goals.”
Jonah has donated some of the proceeds from Jonah’s Hands to Roots Ethiopia. The organization helps families in Ethiopia. That’s the country in Africa where Jonah was born.
What are Jonah’s plans? He wants to be a surgeon. “Being a surgeon requires hand  and patience,” he says. “Crocheting has taught me both of those skills!”

703,703,Should Students Wear Uniforms?,"{'Debate', 'Opinion'}","
Some schools have a policy that says students must wear uniforms to class. Uniforms are often associated with private schools. But they are now becoming more common in public schools. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, uniforms are required at about 22% of public schools in the U.S.
Many schools say uniforms help students focus in class. But some students say uniforms are uncomfortable. Are these policies the best way to keep kids focused on learning? Or should students be allowed to wear what they want?
TIME for Kids asked readers to weigh in. Here, two kids share their opinion about whether students should have to wear uniforms.
YES!

by Yuna Chong, 9
Santa Clara, California
Uniforms are as much about safety as they are about inclusion. Teachers don’t have to worry about losing sight of students at the playground or on a field trip. Also, when kids wear uniforms, both the older and younger students feel like they are part of the same group. I wear a uniform and feel like my school is one big team. I feel included.
I think it is harder to bully someone about his or her clothes if you are all wearing the same thing. When everyone is dressed the same, you don’t have to worry about how you look or about wearing the latest trend. Parents can save money, too! And in the morning, I can save time because I don’t have to choose what clothes I should wear.
NO!

by Emerson Sperling, 12
Sterling Heights, Michigan
I don’t think kids should have to wear a uniform. If students are wearing the exact same thing, they can’t express themselves. Kids should feel like they can be their own person. They shouldn’t have to match.
During school hours, we should be comfortable. If we’re in scratchy shirts and uncomfortable dress pants, we’re not going to focus. I get that the teachers don’t want us focusing on everyone else’s clothing. But it’s still uncomfortable to be in a uniform all day. Also, parents have to go shopping and spend a lot of money on the uniforms.
If students could wear normal clothes to school, we’d be able to express ourselves. We’d be comfortable. And we wouldn’t spend money on outfits that we never wear at home.

The best toys of 2019 can hatch, tumble, light up, battle, and more. Some of the toys, such as Kano’s coding kits or Lego’s Hidden Side play sets, let users create or discover new worlds. Others, like Pictionary Air or the smART Pixelator, offer a new, high-tech upgrade to timeless kid-approved activities. Here, the editors of TIME for Kids round up the best toys of the year.
Jam Session

Ready to rock out? Kids can build their own mini electric guitar and amplifier from scratch with the Tech Will Save Us Electro Guitar Kit. Interactive step-by-step online instructions teach you how to put the instrument and amp together with cardboard, rubber bands, and other provided materials. Kids can then use video tutorials and an online recording studio to learn riffs, record sounds, and share tracks. The do-it-yourself kit takes music education to a whole new level. (Ages 8+)
High-Tech Hedgehog

Maybe the best way to learn about robots is to build one yourself. And My Robotic Pet—Tumbling Hedgehog, by Thames & Kosmos, might be the cutest robot around. First, it must be constructed from 172 pieces, including gears, motors, and sound sensors. A colorful manual alongside a comic-book story will guide you through the process. But building it is only half the fun. Once you’re done, the bionic hedgehog responds to sound commands. Different patterns of claps make it bristle, tumble, spin, and more. (Ages 7+)
String Things

There’s something so satisfying about completing a hands-on art project. Y’Art makes that easy. These yarn-art kits give “by-number” projects a new dimension. Kids use the included yarn to create colorful, textured art pieces. Choose from a selection of designs—from the simple Y’Art Pug Puppy to the more complex Y’Art MasterPiece—The Starry Night. The best part? They’re mistake-proof: If you place the yarn in the wrong spot, just pick it up and go again. (Ages 8+)
Back to the Drawing Board

A well-loved game makes a high-tech comeback. Pictionary Air offers a fun twist on the classic sketch-based version of charades. The original Pictionary relied on pen and paper. But this new version gets players up and moving in a whole new way. To get started, download the free app. As players take their turns drawing in the air with a high-tech pen, point the device’s camera at them. They’ll appear on a phone, tablet, or TV screen along with the sketch they’ve created. (Ages 8+)
A Paranormal Activity

Lego is changing the way kids play with its bricks. The company’s new Hidden Side play sets combine the fun of brick-by-brick building with the interactive experience of augmented reality. Download an app to your smartphone, and with a scan, the Paranormal Intercept Bus 3000 and J.B.’s Ghost Lab come alive in AR. With these sets, kids can venture out on ghost patrol—searching for clues, capturing menacing phantoms, and helping a team of ghost hunters solve mysteries. (Paranormal Intercept Bus, ages 8+; Ghost Lab, ages 7+)
Come Out of Your Shell

Want to train a dragon? Hatching Dragon, based on the popular How to Train Your Dragon franchise, lets kids do just that. The baby dragon’s name is Toothless, and he comes inside an egg. Make him angry, and he’ll move, shake, light up, and tap to be let out. When he’s mad enough, he’ll hatch. Once he’s out, he can play games like Toothless Says, Hot Potato, or Ask Toothless. You can teach him how to fly and dive-bomb, too. But there’s more to Toothless than just being playful. Put your hand over his head, and he’ll purr with affection. (Ages 4+)
Ready, Set, Code

Step into otherworldly adventures with Kano’s Disney Frozen 2 Coding Kit and Star Wars the Force™ Coding Kit. From conjuring ice castles to creating spaceships, these new-for-2019 kits let users build the Frozen and Star Wars worlds while learning how to code. Kids build a sensor that connects to an app. The sensor picks up hand motions, which lets you swing a lightsaber, create a powerful blizzard, and more. (All ages)
A Smart Way to Art

If Perler Beads and Lite-Brite—two classic, kid-approved crafts—joined forces, the result would be smART Pixelator. With smART Pixelator, kids can create their own digital designs and bring them to life. First, upload a photo to the free app, which pixelates the image. The app sends the pixelated image via Bluetooth to the beading device. Easy-to-follow light technology shows you where to place the beads. Just trace the pattern to make your creation. The app also comes with loads of graphic designs to choose from, and for extra fun, the company offers sequins and pegs that can be used instead of beads. (Ages 7+)
Mad Science

Science meets fun in two new lab kits. With Ooze Labs: Alien Slime Lab, kids can concoct batches of unidentified “alien slime.” At first, the sticky, slimy creations will be a mystery. But conducting experiments to learn about each specimen’s special properties—its color, viscosity, ability to change color or glow in the dark—will help you identify just what type of slime it is. With Klutz Maker Lab Candy Science, you can create your own lollipops, marshmallows, fudge, and other sweets. As you follow along in the instruction manual, you’ll learn the science behind these tasty treats. (Ooze Labs: Alien Slime Lab, ages 6+; Klutz Maker Lab Candy Science, ages 8+)
Mission to Mars

Playmobil’s Mars Space Station is the ultimate extraterrestrial play set. The 187-piece kit features everything from sleeping compartments to fitness equipment and a lab for analyzing samples. The main control center lights up, makes sounds, and features a removable roof. And two docking stations can be attached to other Playmobil space sets to create an even bigger base for exploring the cosmos. The set also includes two astronauts, plus all the tools and food they need to survive and thrive in outer space. (Ages 6+)
Drive Me up the Wall

Toy cars are no longer confined to the ground. Spinmaster’s Air Hogs Zero Gravity Laser race car can zoom on the floor—and up the wall! The toy’s vacuum technology uses suction to help the race car go vertical. A laser pointer guides it. Kids can play alone or race against others. Get ready to defy gravity! (Ages 6+)
Battle of the Bots

3Doodler’s Start Robo Sumo 3D Printing Pen Set lets you use a kid-safe version of 3Doodler’s plastic-melting pen to create your own robots. Then you can cheer your robots on as they battle it out in the ring. The kit comes with molds to make arms, gears, wheels, and other robo-parts. The plastic also acts as a glue, so you can attach the robo-parts to one of two rumbling motors. Turn on the motors, place your bots in the center of the ring, and watch them fight to the finish. May the best robot win! (Ages 6 to 13)

Time flies! Before we know it, we’ll be ringing in 2020. But first, the TFK team is taking a look back at 2019. Who was the most important person of the year?
Since 1927, TIME has chosen a Person of the Year. The editors choose the “person or persons who most affected the news and our lives, for good or ill, and embodied what was important about the year, for better or for worse.” That means that the person is not necessarily a hero, and his or her impact is not always positive.
At TIME for Kids, we do it differently. First of all, you help choose. We give you a list of nominees and ask for your vote. Second, we only include people who made a positive impact on the world this year. And finally, we don’t include anyone who ran for elected office in our list of nominees. While politicians have an enormous impact, they’re not the people we want to focus on. Instead, we look for people in a wide range of disciplines and professions who broke barriers, set records, solved problems, and created opportunities.
So who do you think should win? Read on to learn about all eight nominees, then click here or at the bottom of the page to cast your vote. The poll will close on December 5, and we’ll announce the winner in mid-December. Now get to it! Every vote counts. —Andrea Delbanco, Editor-in-Chief

In 2005, scientists saw close-up pictures of Titan, Saturn’s largest moon. The pictures were snapped by a space probe. They showed mountains and . There were riverbeds and lakes, too. That got scientists excited. Where there’s liquid, there could be life.
“It was spectacular to see familiar  on a different world,” Elizabeth Turtle told TIME for Kids. Turtle is a scientist at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, in Maryland. “The processes that shape Titan’s landscape are similar to those that shaped Earth’s.”
Titan could hold clues to how life began on Earth. An  material drops like snow from its atmosphere. The material collects in dunes. Its chemicals mix with liquids on Titan. This is like what happened on Earth 4 billion years ago. That’s when the first life-forms appeared here.
Until now, NASA has used wheeled rovers to study other planets. This summer, NASA agreed to pay for Turtle’s team to build a  craft. It’s called Dragonfly. It will be among the first flying machines used to explore other worlds.
“This mission would have been unthinkable a few years ago,” said NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine. “But we’re ready now for Dragonfly’s amazing flight.”

Taking Flight
Dragonfly will launch in 2026. It will land on Titan in 2034. The craft will have cameras, drills, and a device to suck up materials. It will gather samples for two years and send data back to Earth.
Flying is easy on Titan. The moon has a thick atmosphere and low gravity. A person who went there would be able to strap on wings and fly. “You’d need something to keep you warm,” says Turtle. The temperature on Titan is minus 290°F.
The project is a big step forward for NASA, Turtle says. “We get to bring a whole new dimension—flight—to exploring another world.”

Shape of the Future?
Scientists at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, in California, are testing a robot called Shapeshifter. It looks like a hamster wheel. On Titan, it will roll along until it comes to an obstacle, such as a mountain. Then it will split into two drones. They’ll fly around and gather data. Then they’ll reconnect on the other side.
“Most of the interesting places to study are not on flat surfaces,” says researcher Ali Agha. “They’re on cliff walls, or in caves and potholes.”

Agha imagines a Shapeshifter made of 12 drones. They’ll be able to form a ball, or a chain for exploring caves. They’ll go underwater, too. We can’t know for sure where we’ll find signs of life on Titan,” Agha says. “When you’re dealing with unknown environments, you need to be .”

Saturn Stats
Titan is not Saturn’s only moon. The planet could have as many as 82 moons. Here are other facts to know:
Saturn is the second-largest planet in the solar system. You could fit 764 Earths inside Saturn.The planet’s rings are made of chunks of rock and ice.Saturn is the sixth planet from the sun. It’s about 900 million miles away from the sun.It takes Saturn 29 years to complete one orbit around the sun. That makes its year equal to 29 years on Earth.

A November 1 report by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) lists 10 recent cases of salmonella. The illness broke out across six states. Eight people went to the hospital for it. One has died. Symptoms of salmonella can include fever. They can also include stomach cramps. The illness can last a week. Most people get better without treatment.
The CDC says the salmonella  is probably caused by ground beef. But the source of the meat containing the salmonella bacteria has not yet been found. “Ill people report eating different types and brands of ground beef purchased from many different locations,” says the CDC.
At press time, the CDC and the United States Department of Agriculture were still looking into the outbreak. The CDC had not asked stores to stop selling ground beef. The agency says it’s safe for people to eat meat that has been  cooked. Eating undercooked ground beef is not recommended.

In space, there is no up or down. That’s because there is no  in space. Astronauts and everything else aboard a spacecraft float freely.
Earthlings can experience the feeling of zero gravity without blasting into space. How? A zero-gravity flight. An airplane flies in a series of parabolas, or arcs. Each arc creates a temporary zero-gravity environment. Everyone and everything inside the plane floats freely for about 30 seconds.
“There is truly no other feeling like it on Earth,” Michelle Peters told TIME for Kids. She works for Zero-G. The company organizes zero-gravity flights for scientists and teachers. It also takes passengers as young as 8 on flights that are just for fun.
Space Science
Gravity affects the human body, the behavior of plants, the way machines run, and more. Going to space is expensive and . But zero-gravity flights  the conditions of space. They are a helpful tool for scientists. They create an environment where scientists can experiment.
Nikolaus Kuhn is a scientist. He flew with Zero-G to do research. He studied the flow of water on Mars. There is less gravity on Mars than on Earth. This means water flows more slowly on Mars. Zero-G pilots can make their parabolas less steep. This creates the feeling of Martian gravity.
Flying with Zero-G has been essential for Kuhn’s work. He says it is the only way for him to investigate the behavior of water on Mars without going there.
As humans continue to explore the universe beyond Planet Earth, zero-gravity flights will remain an important—and fun—tool. “It never gets old,” says Peters of Zero-G. “I would do it every weekend for the rest of my life if I could.”

712,712,8 Questions for Jennifer Heldmann,"{'Science', 'Space'}","
Jennifer Heldmann is a planetary scientist. Her team at NASA is looking for water on the moon and Mars. The research will help determine if astronauts can live in these places. Heldmann spoke with TFK Kid Reporter Mira McInnes.
1. Why are scientists excited about discovering water on the moon?
When I was in school, we learned that there was no water on the moon, and that there was no ice. Then we started sending missions there. And the data told us that “Hey, maybe there is water on the moon!” That’s really exciting for a scientist. 
2. How will your research be important for future lunar missions?
If we learn how to use the moon’s water, we can have a base there. Astronauts won’t need to take water with them. They can use the moon’s water. And if you break apart the hydrogen and oxygen in water, you can make rocket fuel.
3. What do you hope to find out about Mars?
There are places on Mars where liquid water has been flowing. It’s only a little, but it means that somewhere, somehow, there’s liquid water on Mars. Is anything living in the water? Are there ? Could there be life on a planet besides Earth?
4. You also do research in Iceland and Antarctica. What can they teach us about other planets?
We learn how ice and water work in cold environments—when water freezes, when it flows, how to drill into ice. Then we apply that knowledge to other planets.
5. How did you get interested in space science?
When I was 10, I saw the movie SpaceCamp. It’s about a group of kids who get launched into space. I loved the movie. When I was in high school, I went to train at Space Camp, in Alabama. It was the most awesome experience ever.
6. What advice can you offer kids who might like to become space scientists?
Read as many books as you can. Visit a science museum or . Email scientists and ask, “What got you interested?” Kids are the future of space exploration. They are going to be the scientists, engineers, astronauts, and artists who’ll make these missions happen.
7. What’s one question about space that science has yet to answer?
The biggest question is, “Are we alone?” We don’t yet know if there’s life on other planets in our solar system, or in other solar systems.
8. Do you have plans to go to space?
Not any time soon. My work is on the ground, making sure astronauts have a safe and productive flight.

Have you ever wondered what Earth looks like from space? Thanks to satellite technology—and a new book—you can see the world from high above. Overview: A New Way of Seeing Earth is filled with photographs taken from satellites. It shows the natural and man-made structures, colors, and shapes that make up our planet. 
The image of Grand Prismatic Spring, in Yellowstone National Park (above), is a great example. “Being able to see the colors helps explain the science of it,” says Benjamin Grant, who wrote the book and chose the photos. “The water in the middle is clear, bright blue. That’s because it’s so hot in the middle that nothing can grow. Just reading about it in a textbook, it wouldn’t make as much sense.”
Grant hopes the images can help visual learners understand the geography of Earth. He told TIME for Kids, “I hope it gets people to be curious and excited about the planet and how we need to protect it.”

TIJUANA, Mexico—On a child’s first day at the Yes We Can World Foundation school, he or she gets two T-shirts, new shoes, and a backpack filled with school supplies. The school is for migrant kids from Central America and Mexico. They have left their homes and traveled north with family to legally ask for  in the U.S. 

But the U.S. has a new policy. It’s called the Migrant Protection , or MPP. It says Central Americans must stay in Mexico as their cases are decided in U.S. Immigration Court (see “Border Crisis”). In the past, they could wait in the U.S. MPP doesn’t apply to Mexicans. They must stay in Mexico too but are put on a waiting list to ask for asylum.
Now thousands of asylum seekers are stuck in Tijuana and other Mexican border cities (see map). People are working to help them as they wait.
Safe Spaces to Learn
The Yes We Can World Foundation school is in Tijuana. It opened in July. The school has 45 students. Lessons are taught in a bus. The bus has been turned into a classroom. Students and their families live in an overcrowded shelter next door. 
“There is no difference between our kids and kids in the U.S.,” Estefanía Rebellón tells me. She’s the school’s cofounder. “Their whole world, their life, is moving. We’re the  part.” 
In October, a group from California donated a second bus. This will allow the school to include 30 more kids. “It’s so awesome to see how kind people can be,” Rebellón says. 

The Schoolbox Project also helps kids in Tijuana. It’s led by volunteers from a group called Border Angels. They go to three shelters each week and help 150 kids. “We try to make a space of safety and trust with the children,” says coordinator Andrea Rincón.
I went to a shelter with the volunteers. There, I met a girl from Honduras. Her name is Michelle. She’s 17 and wants to be a doctor. Michelle told me violence forced her family to flee. “It’s very, very dangerous,” she said about her country.
A New Beginning
In rare cases, migrants might wait in the U.S. as their asylum case is decided. At a shelter in San Diego, California, I met Rina Murillo. She has three sons. They are 14, 10, and 4. Murillo’s family also fled Honduras. “We suffered hunger, cold, and heat” on the journey, she told me.
The family was getting ready to live with a  in Atlanta, Georgia. The older boys will go back to school. I asked 14-year-old David if he was excited. “Mucho [very much],” he said. Science is one of David’s favorite subjects. He looks forward to a fresh start in the U.S. “All the sacrifice was worth it because we are here now,” he said.
Other young migrants stay positive, even as they wait in Mexico. Elizabeth, 6, is from Guatemala. She goes to the Yes We Can school. She dreams of being with family in the U.S. “When I cross into the U.S., I’m going to eat ice cream,” she says, “and play with my cousin.”

Border Crisis
At least 900,000 migrants have come to the U.S.-Mexico border since October 2018. The U.S. government calls it a “ and security crisis.” In response, the U.S. has created the Migrant Protection Protocols, or MPP. 
The government says MPP “will help restore a safe and orderly immigration process.” It says Mexico will give migrants humanitarian protections. MPP began in January. Since then, more than 50,000 migrants have been made to wait in Mexico.
But Human Rights Watch says MPP puts people at risk. Crime is common in some Mexican border towns where migrants wait.
Waiting in Mexico also makes it hard for migrants to meet with U.S. lawyers. “What’s really going to make a difference in an asylum seeker’s case is good legal representation,” Lea Bush says. She works with Jewish Family Service of San Diego. Last year, the group helped more than 17,000 asylum seekers.

Last December, Estefanía Rebellón volunteered to help migrant families in Tijuana, Mexico. The city is near San Diego, California, along the U.S.-Mexico border. Some of the people Rebellón met in Tijuana had traveled thousands of miles. Many had left home to ask for protection in the U.S. Now they were living in crowded shelters. Some were camped out in tents. “I was concerned about what was happening,” Rebellón told TIME for Kids. “People were very much in need.” 
The trip sparked an idea. “When I came back home to Los Angeles, California, I thought, ‘We have to do something.’” She decided to start a school. Often, migrant children and families spend months outside the classroom. Rebellón wanted to help kids continue their education.
She knew from experience how important school can be for kids on the move. When Rebellón was 10 years old, her family fled violence in Colombia. Like other newcomers to the U.S., they found safety in Miami, Florida. “Our whole lives changed,” Rebellón says. “For me, school was where I felt like I met kids who were going through the same things that I was.” 
Rebellón and her team opened the Yes We Can World Foundation school in July. Classes are taught in English and in Spanish. The school currently serves 45 students who live with their families in the shelter next door. Rebellón says it is the first bilingual school program for migrant kids on the U.S.-Mexico border. 
Rebellón travels between Los Angeles and Tijuana on a regular basis. When I visited her at the Yes We Can school in October, students ran to hug her the minute they spotted her in the schoolyard. Here are photos from that trip, alongside Rebellón’s answers to questions from TIME for Kids.

Why did you decide to start the school?
In my experience as a child coming to the U.S. from Colombia, school was the only safe space that I had. The teachers that helped me were my rock. So I decided to start the school in Tijuana because I see myself in these kids. I see what they’re going through. A personal goal of mine is to help our students realize that they are valued and that their voice matters and their stories matter.
What makes your school unique?
Some of our students have been on the road longer than they have been at the shelter, so their schooling has already been interrupted for so long. What we're providing is a relief education program. It helps fill the gap. In our program, we accept kids the day they come in to the shelter next door. So if the family shows up today, they'll be in our program immediately. 
Where do your students come from?
It's a mix. We have kids from Central America. But right now we're seeing a rise in Mexican students, because there's a lot of problems in specific parts of the country, including the Mexican states of Michoacán and Guerrero. People are leaving by the thousands. So we get new students every week.

What’s a typical day like at your school?
Our school day goes from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. From 9 to 11, you'll see the class activities happening. Then the kids eat lunch from 11 to 11:30, and 11:30 to 12 is playtime. From 12 to 2 is the rest of the activities. 
School lunches are provided by World Central Kitchen, right?
Yes. I really, truly love those guys. They’re just like us. They’re very action-driven. As soon as we knew we were going to start the school, I texted one of my friends who works for World Central Kitchen and said, “Hey, this is what we’re doing. Do you think you guys can help us with the school lunches?” He was like, “Yes, when do you start?” And they added us to their calendar. 
What challenges do your students face?
All of our kids have different needs. It's not like a regular classroom where you can be like, “OK, all of you guys are in first grade; all you guys are in second grade. Everything we've done has been created from scratch. We had to create a curriculum that is specific to migrant children. 
What feedback have you gotten from parents?
A lot of the parents said, “You know, I used to have to drag my kids to school. Now they line up to be here. They want to be here. They love coming here.”
What do you want people to know about your students?
We hope people understand that there is no difference between our kids and the kids in the U.S. They smile the same way, they hurt the same way, they're curious, they're just so excited to be alive. 
What’s next for you and the Yes We Can World Foundation?
Our goal is to grow the program. Right now, we're working on having a little bus that's going to go pick up kids from other shelters in Tijuana. We’re also hoping to open a school in Juárez, across the border from El Paso, Texas. Juárez has a lot of migrants from Central America. So the school would be mostly Central American kids. We’re hoping to open by the end of this year.

General Motors (GM) workers approved a new contract with the company on October 26. This ended a 40-day autoworker strike.
When employees have a dispute with their employer, they may go on strike. They protest by refusing to work. The strike at GM was organized by United Automobile Workers (UAW). The union protects workers’ rights. Every four years, UAW meets with GM to sign a new contract. This time, the two could not reach an agreement. 
On September 15, some 49,000 workers walked off the job. More than 50 auto factories and warehouses stopped work. GM and UAW spent weeks . In the end, GM increased . It also agreed to pay newer employees a higher wage. The wage is closer to what longtime employees earn. All workers will also get an $11,000 bonus. But GM will still close three factories.

P.S. 139 is in Brooklyn, New York. It has a school garden where students grow fruits and vegetables. It also has a school cookbook filled with recipes that use those foods. And it has a technology club, a soccer club, and a renovated teachers’ lounge. 
All of this is thanks to a process called participatory budgeting, or PB. Through PB, students, parents, teachers, and staff decide how to use some of the school’s money. In the past three years, P.S. 139 has spent nearly $50,000 this way. 
Budget Talks
Usually, only school leaders decide how to divvy a budget. PB lets others weigh in. Shari Davis is one of the people in charge of the Participatory Budgeting Project. That’s a nonprofit group in New York and California. “PB invites folks to take part in decisions,” she told TIME for Kids. “People who are closest to the issues in a community are often also closest to solving them.” 
How does PB work? First, members of a school community think about changes they’d like to see. They submit their ideas to a committee. The committee organizes the ideas into detailed plans. The plans include the estimated cost of each project. 
Then everyone votes. Projects that get the most votes are funded. 
Participatory Budgeting Project cofounder Josh Lerner helped bring PB to P.S. 139. He finds that leaders are often surprised by the results. PB helps them “understand what their communities need,” he says. 
Money Is Power
In 2018, New York City started using PB in public schools. Now each of the city’s 400 high schools gets $2,000 a year to spend using PB. (P.S. 139 is an elementary school. Its PB money is raised by the school and its Parent Association.)
“We’re changing the story that says that young people are future leaders,” Davis says. “I think young people are leaders right now.""

The Lightning Thief is a best-selling book by Rick Riordan. It has been translated into more than 40 languages. In 2010, it was made into a movie. Now the story of Percy Jackson’s quest to find Zeus’s lightning bolt is a Broadway musical.
The Lightning Thief: The Percy Jackson Musical opened in 2017 at a small theater in New York City. It went on a tour of 32 cities in the United States. Then it returned to New York. This time, it’s at Broadway’s Longacre Theatre.
The show was written by Joe Tracz. He had the job of  Riordan’s book for the stage. “You can’t sum up a 377-page book in a two-hour play,” Tracz told TIME for Kids. “You have to leave some parts out. This is very hard because if we don’t include someone’s favorite part, they might not like the show.”
When Tracz first set out to write the musical, he wanted to strike a tone that was different from that of the movie. “Percy is such a fun-loving kid,” he says. “But the movie is super serious. Instead, we tried to make the musical funny and entertaining.”
Tracz hopes the musical is an  experience. “In a movie, everything is happening onscreen,” he says. “But in a play, you are in the story with the actors. You are part of the play.”
Role Call 
The show’s seven actors play 47 parts. Some have only one role to play. Others have several.

Actor Kristin Stokes plays just one part, but it’s an important one. She portrays Annabeth, a daughter of the goddess Athena. She helps Percy on his quest. TFK spoke to Stokes about how she prepared for her role. She says some aspects were challenging to get right. “The fight choreography was especially hard because it had to look like we were really fighting,” she says.
How does Stokes get ready for each performance? “I do some meditation, ground myself, and start with a clean slate,” she says.
The Lightning Thief is scheduled to run on Broadway for 16 weeks.

LA LIMA, Honduras—It’s 9:00 on a steamy August morning. Students at the Gabriela Mistral school playfully line up. They stand between two yellow cords in the school courtyard. A volunteer from the Honduran Red Cross calls out a question. “Do you have a family member who has left the country?” To answer no, kids step over the cord on their right. To answer yes, they step left. Nearly all 15 students step left.
In most cases, the family member has gone to the U.S. “Some children, their parents  and they stay here,” Karen Martínez tells me in Spanish. She’s a Red Cross volunteer. She helps kids affected by migration. Sometimes, families go north together. Other times, kids go alone.

Akon Spencer takes part in the activity. He’s 12. He wants to play professional fútbol (soccer). His mom and 7-year-old brother, Laer, are watching. The three of them left for the U.S. in April. Their goal was to be with the boys’ grandfather, in New York City.
“Most of the time, we traveled by bus,” Akon tells me. We talk at the family’s small home. It’s on a dirt road near the school. “In Guatemala, we walked part of the way.” But in Mexico, they were stopped. They were held in detention. In May, they were sent back to Honduras on a bus with other migrants. This can happen if a person does not have the documents needed to formally cross the U.S.-Mexico border.
“I love my country,” Akon’s mom, Selma Blanco, says. “But the dream is for a better future for my kids.”

People On the Move
Since October 2018, at least 900,000 migrants and people seeking asylum (see “Seeking Safety”) have arrived at the southwestern U.S. border. Most come from one of three countries in Central America. These are Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador.

Some people come to escape . In Honduras, more than 66% of the population lives in poverty. Others are  violence. Gangs control entire neighborhoods in Honduras. They demand money from people.
Often, it’s a combination of things that pushes someone to leave. For many in Central America, life is tough. People go north even though the U.S. government has strict rules in place to stop what it says is an overwhelming number of people arriving at the border.

To Stay or to Go?
Luis Amaya is the principal at Gabriela Mistral. He says that in the past year, 1,800 students from the area have left for the U.S.
“We try to give them all the support they need. But many parents still think it’s better to migrate,” Amaya tells me. “They say, ‘We are still unemployed. There is still gang activity, there is still . We need to feed our families.’”
“It’s hard,” he adds. “People find themselves in situations where they don’t know where to go or what to do.”
Seeking Safety
Asylum seekers are people who are asking for protection in a new country. They do this because they are in danger in their home country. International law says a person can legally enter a foreign country to ask for asylum. He or she must then meet the legal requirements for protection.
A new U.S. policy could stop most people from Central America from asking for asylum here. The policy says a person must ask for asylum in one of the countries that he or she passes through. For example, a person from Honduras would have to be denied asylum in Guatemala or Mexico before asking in the U.S.
Immigrant-rights groups say they will fight the policy. They say Guatemala and Mexico are also dangerous. They say these countries do not have systems in place to properly handle requests for asylum.

For the past year or so, the news has been filled with stories about migrants coming to the U.S. from Central America. I wanted to understand why people were leaving their home countries. So in August, I went to Honduras to learn what it’s like to live there. Many of the people I met expressed pride in their country. They love their home, and they don’t want to leave. But they also struggle. Jobs are hard to find, educational opportunities are limited, and gang activity is widespread. Many people feel they have no choice but to flee and try to start over in the U.S. During my visit, I asked young people to tell me about their country, their community, and what they know about migration. Here’s what they had to say.


Ten-year-old Stephanie Dubón (third from left) takes part in a young journalists program in Puerto Cortés. It’s supported by the Canadian government and UNICEF, the United Nations Children’s Fund. Participants’ stories, which are broadcast on local TV, highlight positive activities and challenges in the community. Dubón says, “There are a lot of people who are hungry and don’t have a chance to have an education.”


“In the past five years, I know a lot of young people who have migrated to the United States,” says Evans Paz (center), 18. “Some of them have parents already in the U.S., and they want to be with them again.” According to UNICEF, 43% of children in Honduras do not live with their parents because the parents have migrated to other countries in search of employment.


Astrid Ponse, 12, of Villanueva, loves watching the U.S. Women’s National Team play soccer and listening to the British rock band Queen. After school, she participates in a UNICEF-supported soccer program. It provides a safe space where children can disconnect from the stress of daily life. “There are a lot of risks for people on the journey,” Astrid says when talking about migration from Honduras to the U.S.


Berkling Yaiso (left) is 9. His brother Germán is 10. Here, at a community meeting in Potrerillos, they pose with one of their teachers. “At the beginning of the school year,” she says, “we found out that a lot of children had migrated to the United States.” Berkling and Germán left with their mom in March 2018, she says, but came back nine months later after experiencing hardship along the way.


Luis Bonilla, 16, studies computers and robotics at a high school in El Progreso. His mom fears losing her job at a factory and says that if she does, she may head north in search of better opportunities. “People don’t migrate to the U.S. because they want to,” Luis says. “They go because they need more income.” In Honduras, more than 66% of the population lives in poverty.


Twelve-year-old Stacyl Mendoza goes to school in El Progreso. She’s in a special program for retornados, people who’ve tried to migrate to the U.S. but have returned to Honduras. Stacyl says she and her family were arrested in Mexico and spent nine days in jail. “It was horrible,” she says. When she grows up, Stacyl wants to be a motivational speaker.

American astronauts Christina Koch and Jessica Meir have made history. On October 18, they completed the first-ever all-female . The two floated outside the International Space Station (ISS). They repaired part of its power .
The spacewalk lasted seven hours and 17 minutes. People around the world watched NASA’s livestream of the event.
“We don’t want to take too much credit because there have been many others—female spacewalkers—before us,” Meir said on a call with President Donald Trump. He called the ISS to congratulate the women. “This is really just doing our job,” Meir added.
The world’s first spacewalk took place in 1965. Since then, there have been 227 spacewalkers. Only 15 of them have been women.
An all-female spacewalk was originally scheduled for March. But there were not enough medium-sized suits. So that walk was done by a male and a female astronaut instead.

Archaeologists in Egypt have uncovered 30 ancient coffins. The coffins contain well-preserved mummies. This is the largest discovery of its kind since the 19th century. Details of the find were announced on October 19.
The wooden coffins are estimated to be 3,000 years old. They’re decorated with hieroglyphs. Experts believe that many of the mummies buried in these coffins were priests in ancient Egypt.
Egyptian archaeologists found the coffins in Luxor. Luxor was once the ancient city of Thebes. “I’m very happy we found this discovery with Egyptian hands,” Mostafa Waziri told NBC News.

Movies about rock climbing show people reaching the highest peaks in the world. But you don’t need to climb a mountain to feel the excitement. Climbing gyms are opening across the United States. The sport is growing more popular by the minute. About 1,000 to 1,500 people in the U.S. climb for the first time each day. That’s according to 2015 statistics reported by the International Federation of Sport Climbing.
TFK Kid Reporter Priscilla L. Ho was one of these first-time climbers. “Fear was the first emotion I felt,” she says. But it “turned into  when I reached the top.”
Justen Sjong used to be a professional rock climber. Now he’s a senior director at El Cap. El Cap is a company that owns two climbing-gym networks. One is called Earth Treks. Its Englewood, Colorado, location is the biggest indoor climbing gym in the country. Sjong thinks of climbing as the “physical version of chess.” He says, “You are presented with a boulder or a problem on the wall, and you’re to solve it with your body.”
Big Competition
Many people climb just for fun. Some do it at birthday parties. Others climb at summer camps. But some people take climbing seriously as a sport. Logan Schlecht is 11. He’s a member of the competitive climbing team at the Sender One gym in Santa Ana, California.
A  about rock climbing is that it’s all about physical strength. “It’s not,” Logan says. “It’s really the ability to push yourself to the limit and know that you’re able to do this.”
Soon climbing will be an Olympic sport. Climbers will compete for the first time next year at the 2020 Summer Games. The Games will be held in Tokyo, Japan.
So far, one athlete has qualified for the U.S. Olympic Climbing Team: 18-year-old Brooke Raboutou. She told Climbing magazine, “I hope I can help the sport grow and introduce new people to the joys of climbing.”

729,729,What's the Password?,"{'The View', 'Media Literacy'}","
In an ancient folktale, a giant rock blocks the entrance to a cave that’s filled with treasure. A door appears only for those who speak a secret phrase: “Open, sesame!” This is an early example of a password. 
Passwords have changed since then. Now they  digital treasures, such as documents, pictures, and messages. But the reason the phrases exist is the same: to keep the wrong people out. 
In the digital world, these “wrong people” are called hackers. If they can figure out a person’s password, they can access private information. They can then use that information to commit crimes.
What Not To Do
Jessica Covarrubias works at Google. She is the education-program lead. Her team designs games that teach students about Internet security. 
Covarrubias says there are passwords to avoid if you want to be safe online. “The most popularly used passwords are password and 123456,” she told TIME for Kids.
Hackers can also find public information, such as a birthday or a pet’s name, about their potential . They type this information into programs that guess the target’s passwords. 
Security Matters
One of the best ways for kids to keep their information secure is by thinking up strong passwords. So how can you invent a password that’s easy for you to remember but hard for someone else to guess?
“Think of a fun phrase,” says Covarrubias. This can be a lyric from a favorite song. It could also be the title of a book or movie. It’s best if the phrase is relevant to your life. You will be less likely to forget it. 
Then, says Covarrubias, “take the first letter or first couple of letters from each word in that phrase, and begin switching those letters to symbols or numbers.” Use a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, too. This makes the password even trickier to crack.

On August 30, college-sports fans celebrated College Colors Day. A fourth grader at Altamonte Elementary School, in Florida, wanted to show support for the University of Tennessee (U.T.) Volunteers. He didn’t have one of the team’s  orange shirts. So he drew the U.T. logo on a piece of paper. Then he pinned the paper to an orange T-shirt. At school, other kids teased him for wearing it. “He was devastated,” his teacher Laura Snyder wrote online on September 4.
Snyder’s post caught the attention of U.T.’s president. On September 6, the university announced that it would use the student’s design for its official T-shirt. After this statement, the college store’s website had so many visitors that it crashed. “My student has definitely felt the love and support,” Snyder wrote online.

For a Cause
As of mid-September, more than 50,000 orders had been placed for the T-shirt. The student’s family had decided to donate proceeds from its sale. The money will go to Stomp Out Bullying. That’s a national organization. It opposes bullying and cyberbullying. The group has helped more than 5 million students  bullying situations. “It’s the most incredible thing for this family to give to a ,” Ross Ellis told TIME for Kids. She started Stomp Out Bullying in 2005.

Ellis says kids are finding ways to make the world kinder. “Kids just don’t want bullying in their schools anymore,” she says. “They’re tired of it.”
Ripple Effect
How can people prevent bullying? Ellis says they can become upstanders. An upstander supports someone who’s being bullied. Also, schools can do antibullying activities throughout October, which is National Bullying Prevention Month. Stomp Out Bullying posts them online.
In many schools, kindness is promoted beyond October. Joanne Miller is a fourth-grade teacher at Pride Elementary School. That’s in Deltona, Florida. She told TFK that her class wants to “start a kindness revolution.” Miller’s students call themselves the Kindness Squad. They wear special T-shirts. They greet other kids with kind words on Friday mornings. Deliana Black is on the Kindness Squad. She’s 9. “The small things we do for our class and our school make everyone happy,” she says.

“One act starts a ripple effect,” Miller says. “If one person does something, then the next person does something, and the next.” Ellis, of Stomp Out Bullying, hopes the ripple effect started by the U.T. shirt will continue. The money donated from its sale, she says, “will go far in helping kids who haven’t been helped yet.”
Standing Together 
The kindness revolution is happening in high schools, too. Lou Riolo is the principal of Carmel High School. That’s in New York. This year, he asked the graduating class to be silent when senior Jack Higgins took the stage at graduation. Jack has a form of autism. It makes him oversensitive to sound. Students gave Higgins a silent standing ovation.

TFK spoke with Higgins’s mom, Barbara. “It just takes a little bit of kindness and compassion [to think] about someone else,” she says. “If everybody did that for a minute a day, the world would just be amazing."" —By Ellen Nam

A wildfire began on October 10 in Southern California. More than 100,000 people were forced to leave their homes. The Saddleridge Fire tore across more than 12 square miles around Los Angeles. It damaged at least 58 buildings.
The fire began in the evening. By the next morning, more than 1,000 firefighters were battling it. By October 13, the fire had been contained.
The cause of the Saddleridge Fire is unknown. It was fueled by dry plants and trees. They were brittle after a hot California summer. The fire was then spread by powerful winds. “The  from the wind have been traveling a significant distance, which causes another fire to start,” Ralph Terrazas said. He’s the Los Angeles fire chief.
Other parts of California were also on high alert for fires. In Northern California and the central part of the state, the Pacific Gas and Electric Company switched off electricity to more than 2 million people. This was done to prevent fires. High winds increased the chances that power lines would fall and ignite a blaze.

Not long ago, toy stores had separate aisles for boys and girls. People spoke out against this, and retailers listened. Target, for example, got rid of boys’ and girls’ toy sections in 2015.

In 2012, Topher White visited a wildlife sanctuary in Indonesia. He was hiking through the rain forest when he came across a man cutting down a huge tree.
White was watching illegal logging in action. Illegal logging is a big problem in rain forests around the world. It contributes to climate change and destroys  for forest creatures.
The logger fled the scene. But the experience bothered White. He knew the wildlife sanctuary employed rangers to watch out for illegal loggers. But the guards hadn’t known about the man White saw. How did they miss him?
White, a trained engineer, thought technology could help fight . “The rain forest is a noisy place. But it’s also a noisy thing to cut a tree down,” he told TIME for Kids. “It struck me that there had to be a way to hear this.”
All Ears
White created a device he calls a Guardian. It’s a recycled smartphone powered by solar panels. Guardians can pick up the sound of a chain saw from nearly a mile away. They are mounted on trees.
When a Guardian detects a chain saw, it sends an alert to rangers. The rangers then set off to stop the illegal activity.
“If you respond the moment you get the alert, there’s a chance that you can show up before much of the tree has even been cut,” White says.
Working Together
White installed the first Guardians in Indonesia, at the wildlife sanctuary where he had the idea for the project. Two days later, the devices helped rangers interrupt a logger. “That convinced me others could use this too,” White says.
White started a nonprofit group called Rainforest Connection. It builds and installs Guardians all over the world. The group now covers 90,000 square miles of rain forest in 10 countries.

UNITED NATIONS, New York—It’s Saturday, September 21, at 10 a.m. Five people are seated at the center of the Trusteeship Council Chamber. Four of them are youth climate activists. The fifth is United Nations (U.N.) secretary-general António Guterres. Typically, he’d be the one to welcome a room full of people to the U.N. But today, he isn’t here to talk. He’s here to listen. 
Greta Thunberg, 16, from Sweden, speaks first. Many look up to her as the leader of the youth climate movement. To Greta’s left sits Bruno Rodriguez, 16, from Argentina. He speaks next. “Our world leaders have the obligation to make  change,” Bruno says. “Let’s stop demanding [they] listen to science and start demanding they act on science.”
This call echoed throughout the first-ever United Nations Youth Climate Summit. About a thousand people attended. Many of them had marched in the Global Climate Strike, the day before. At both events, their demand was the same: for companies and governments to take urgent action against .

International Group 
The U.N. is an international organization. Every September, representatives from its 193 nations come together for a weeklong U.N. General Assembly to discuss world issues. The 2019 meeting focused on climate.
The Youth Climate Summit was held before the General Assembly. Young activists shared their ideas. One session focused on STEM solutions, such as an app that helps people make  shopping choices. Another session featured Olympic athletes.

Much of the excitement happened beyond the summit’s formal schedule. In hallways, activists who had known each other only through social media met for the first time. Outside, attendees interviewed each other for podcasts and videos. “It’s just been so inspiring, all the people coming together,” said Laura Lock, 17, from England.

Hope Ahead
Jayathma Wickramanayake, U.N.  on youth, says the summit was held to  the voices of young activists. “We wanted to give the opportunity to young people to speak truth to power,” she told TIME for Kids.
Isabel Pronto Breslin, 15, attended the summit. She’s from Rhinebeck, New York. Isabel says that hearing from other young activists gives her hope. “More and more people are seeing how much of a problem we face,” she told TFK. “More and more people are committed to fighting it.”

Felíquan Charlemagne
Age: 17
Location: Florida, USA
Felíquan was born on Saint Thomas, in the U.S. Virgin Islands. He has experienced the effects of climate change firsthand. “My island has seen natural disasters, from hurricanes to rising tides,” Felíquan told TFK’s Shay Maunz. “All that stuff has directly affected the economy and forced me to move to where I live today, in Florida.”
Now, Felíquan is the creative and co-executive director of the U.S. Youth Climate Strike. What advice does he have for young kids who want to take action? “Talk to your parents,” Felíquan says. “Make sure they know what politicians are the best on climate policy and who they’re going to vote for. . . . Make sure they know how important it is to you.”


Eva Jones
Age: 17
Location: Oregon, USA
Eva Jones is passionate about gender equality and climate action. As the founding president of her high school’s Girl Up club, she’s able to fight for both. “I truly believe that one of the main solutions to stopping climate change is going to be educating girls and empowering women,” she told TFK’s Allison Singer. 
Girl Up is an organization founded by the United Nations Foundation. It helps girls advocate and fundraise for issues regarding gender equality. “I’m a problem-solver,” Eva says. “I’m very much a person of action, and I love that aspect of Girl Up: that whatever you want to do, whatever idea you have, Girl Up is there to help you implement it.” 
Does Eva see climate change as a big problem to solve? “Yes,” she says. “And I’m so ready to tackle it.”


Laura Lock
Age: 17
Location: United Kingdom
It wasn’t until she joined the climate strikes that Laura realized how important it was to take action on this issue. The strikes “get a lot of criticism about whether they actually have an impact,” she told TFK’s Shay Maunz. “But with all the media attention, I think the most important thing they do is raise awareness. They encourage people to go out and do their own research and educate themselves. And that’s crucial.”
According to Laura, the strike on September 20 was the first one that adults were asked to join. “Up until this point, it’s been about giving a voice to children, a voice to those who can’t vote,” she says. “That hasn’t changed. But by inviting adults to join us, it’s symbolic to show that we recognize that we can’t do this alone.” Climate action, she adds, requires cooperation “between generations, between countries, between groups.”


Aditya Mukarji
Age: 15
Location: India
Aditya is focused on plastics. In India, he helps organizations find ways to better sort their waste, so that plastics can be sent for recycling. He also helps organizations make the switch from plastics to more eco-friendly alternatives. “I’m hopeful for the future,” he told TFK’s Allison Singer. “That is, if we make change right now, today, and not just some other day.”
Aditya was impressed by his fellow attendees at the summit. “All these youth who have come here are excellent in their fields. They are all the best, and they are trying to empower other people to work towards saving the climate,” he says. “They all have the same ideals—to save the climate—but they all have a different approach.” 


Lesein Mathenge Mutunkei
Age: 15
Location: Kenya
At the U.N. Youth Climate Summit, Lesein told others about his Trees4Goals initiative. When he began it in 2018, he planted one tree for every soccer goal he scored. Now, he plants 10 trees for every goal. Fortunately, Lesein is good at soccer. He’s planted more than 200 trees so far. “I also keep track of the places I plant the trees,” he told TFK’s Brian McGrath, “so I can make sure the trees are not just planted, but that they are growing.”
Lesein wants to learn new ways he can help save the planet. “Any little thing you do can help, no matter how small,” he says. “Whether it’s planting a tree, or picking up litter, even sharing information on social media—anything counts, as much as you think it doesn’t. People have to know that it counts.”


Anya Sastry
Age: 17
Location: Illinois, USA
Anya is the national outreach director for the U.S. Youth Climate Strike. She works to ensure that people from all communities are involved in climate action. “There are many people who are on the front lines of the crisis, but who are not at the forefront of the movement,” she told TFK’s Candace Dipsey. People developing climate solutions need to make sure those solutions “are going to affect everyone in a positive manner,” she adds.
Anya warns that being an activist can be a tough job. “Oftentimes, you’re putting your blood, sweat, and tears into what you’re doing,” she says. “It’s challenging because you’re sacrificing so much of yourself to help the people around you and to advocate for what you believe in.” Her advice? “Support your fellow activists, because having a good activist network and support system will help you.”

Originally from Japan, Akari is a ninth-grader at the United Nations International School in New York City. “We’ve been focusing a lot on zero waste and making sure our waste is in the right bins,” Akari told TFK’s Allison Singer. Now, Akari is trying to convince her school’s administration to install solar panels. 
If students want to make their schools more eco-friendly, Akari says the best way to start is by looking for allies. “Find passionate teachers,” she says. “And find passionate friends, because there’s strength in numbers. That’s where you can really get together and get your voice out to the people in your school who can make changes.”


Htet Myet Min Tun

Htet led an environmental conservation group at his school. The group’s goal was to raise awareness in Myanmar about climate change. “We invited experts about climate change to our school, and we held talks about climate change and environmental conservation,” he told TFK’s Jaime Joyce. “We also held essay competitions and poster competitions. And we led campaigns, like planting-trees events.”
At the summit, Htet met young activists from countries such as Nepal, Russia, and South Korea. “They did really amazing work in their countries,” he says. “I was very inspired by them. No matter where you’re from, we all have the same goal: to build a better world for ourselves and future generations.”


Lourdes Vano
Age: 17

When Lourdes joined the climate action movement in Auckland, New Zealand, she noticed a lack of diversity in the group. “That wasn’t what I wanted to see,” she told TFK’s Karena Phan. Lourdes’s family is from Samoa and the Cook Islands. Her father is of Maori descent. The Maori are the indigenous people of New Zealand (or Aotearoa, the Maori name for the country). “I believe that indigenous people were the first climate protectors,” she says. “We’re so connected with the land. It’s important to us that it’s protected and taken care of.”
Lourdes attended the U.N. Youth Climate Summit to represent the people of the Pasifika islands. “I feel a responsibility to bring those voices up to such a global scale,” she says. “Indigenous people have been trying to protect the land for years, and we need those voices back.”

The Ocean Cleanup has a system for removing plastic from the sea. The group ran into problems early on. But now the system is up and working.
“I am very proud to share with you that we are now catching plastics,” the group’s founder, Boyan Slat, says. He spoke to reporters on October 2.
The Ocean Cleanup system is a floating . It uses a giant screen that hangs below the water’s surface. The screen traps pieces of plastic as they float by. It does not trap marine animals.
The barrier didn’t work well last year. It floated at the same speed as the plastic it was meant to catch. Since then, an underwater parachute has been added. This slows down the barrier. Now it can catch the faster-moving plastics.
 The device is being used in an area of the Pacific Ocean known as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. Some 1.8 trillion pieces of plastic have collected there. The pollution harms animals. It also gets into the food chain. Slat hopes to get half of the trash cleaned up by 2025.
The next step is to improve the barrier so it will be able to gather plastic trash for a year. Then a ship will carry the trash away. “It’s definitely not going to be easy,” Slat says.
Stop and Think! What questions would you ask Boyan Slat if you were to write an article about the Ocean Cleanup system? How would you come up with interview questions?

Mario and the Hole in the Sky is based on the true story of Mario Molina. He was a Mexican scientist who helped solve a big problem.

In late August, Hurricane Dorian formed over the Atlantic Ocean. The storm hit the Bahamas on September 1. It  buildings, flooded neighborhoods, and killed 51 people. Many regions were left without power or water.
As soon as the storm passed, a team of chefs and other volunteers sprang into action. They assembled helicopters, ships, seaplanes, and trucks. They set up  kitchens. They began churning out 30,000 meals a day. Then they started delivering food. They went to schools, clinics, and churches. Leading the charge was chef José Andrés.

Andrés owns popular restaurants in the United States. He’s also the founder of World Central Kitchen (WCK). That’s a nonprofit group. It cooks meals for people affected by natural disasters and other emergencies. 
“We will make it to everyone who needs food, one way or another,” Andrés told TIME for Kids from the Bahamas. At press time, WCK had served about 300,000 meals there.
Chefs in Action
WCK began the disaster-relief phase of its mission in 2016. That’s when Hurricane Matthew hit Haiti. It left many people without food. 
Usually, after an emergency, relief agencies give out , prepackaged meals. Some of the food isn’t very healthy. Often, it doesn’t taste great. 
Andrés thought he could do better. As a chef, he had experience finding ingredients. He was good at creating recipes. And he was skilled at running a kitchen. Plus, he knew the power of food. “A hot meal represents love. It represents hope and ,” Andrés says. “This human connection is so important when people are deeply affected by disaster.”

The food served by WCK is fresh and healthy. When possible, it incorporates local ingredients. Recipes are designed to appeal to the tastes of the region. 
WCK chefs have shortcuts for cooking large amounts of food quickly. Andrés grew up in Spain. There, cooks use massive pans to make a rice dish called paella. He realized paella pans could be used for all kinds of food. Now WCK cooks use them for everything from pasta to jambalaya. They can cook for 500 people at a time this way.
“When there’s a medical emergency, who do you send in? Doctors, of course,” says Nate Mook. He is WCK’s executive director. “When there’s a food emergency, we should send in the people who know food best—and that’s chefs.”

Better Together
WCK has about 25 staff members. But much of its work is done by volunteers. Many are from the affected areas. Twenty thousand volunteers served almost 4 million meals after Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico, in 2017. 
Andrés told TFK about a 10-year-old girl there named Lola. She ran an entire section of the kitchen on her own. “She became a general in my army of volunteers,” he says. “She’s my hero.”

Clean Cooking
In Haiti, it’s common for school meals to be cooked indoors over open fires. This can be dangerous. And it’s not healthy for students, teachers, and cooks. They breathe smoke from the flames.
WCK wants to help. The group has built or renovated more than 140 schools in Haiti. In many of them, it has installed gas stoves. It has also installed sinks and water lines. That makes cleanup easier. 
Together, this has made schools cleaner and safer for more than 65,000 people.

747,747,TFK Explains: The Impeachment Process,"{'United States', 'Government'}","
On September 24, the U.S. House of Representatives said it would start an impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump.
What is an impeachment inquiry?
If a U.S. president is suspected of committing “, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors,” the House of Representatives can  him or her. The Constitution gives them this power. In an impeachment inquiry, the House investigates whether there is enough evidence for a case. If there is, a case can go forward. If the president is found guilty, the Senate has the power to remove him or her from office.
Why has the House decided to launch an inquiry?
An anonymous complaint was filed in August. It says that Trump pushed the president of Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and his son for wrongdoing. Biden is the former vice president. Now he is running for president. The Democrats might pick him as their nominee. If they do, Biden would compete against Trump in the 2020 presidential election. 
Nancy Pelosi is Speaker of the House. She announced the impeachment inquiry on September 24. She said that asking a foreign power to investigate an opponent shows Trump’s “betrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of our national security, and betrayal of the integrity of our elections.”
Trump says he has done nothing wrong. He says he will fight impeachment. “It’s all a big hoax,” he said on September 25. 
How does impeachment work?
It starts with a House investigation. The House can then put forth a document. It is called the “articles of impeachment.” If members vote in favor of the articles, the president is impeached. That is the same as being charged with a crime. 
What does the Senate do if the House votes to impeach? 
The Senate holds a trial. In it, House members make a case against the president. The Senate acts as the jury. The trial is overseen by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. Currently, the Senate is led by Republicans. They are likely to dismiss any case against Trump.   
Has a U.S. president been impeached before?
Yes. Both Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton were impeached. They were found not guilty at trial and they were not removed from office. 
Stop and Think! Why does the press report on the activities of the U.S. government? Is it important to keep up with news about the president and Congress?

Want to know something special about Olivia Bean, Trivia Queen, by Donna Gephart? The book’s first draft was written inside 30 days, during National Novel Writing Month (NaNoWriMo). 
NaNoWriMo is a writing challenge. It takes place each year in November. Writers around the world take part. Their goal? To write a 50,000-word novel in a month. Kids can participate too. NaNoWriMo has a Young Writers Program. The idea is the same, but kids can set a shorter word count. 
Marya Brennan runs the Young Writers Program. She says about 100,000 young people and educators join the challenge each year. “In school, you read books, you do a lot of consuming,” she told TIME for Kids. NaNoWriMo gives kids an opportunity to create. And they get to do it on their own terms, without parents or teachers telling them what to write.
Sophia Eftychiou is 14. She took part in NaNoWriMo in 2017. “I’ve always had stories on my mind,” she told TFK. “NaNoWriMo, for me, was an open opportunity to  my stories onto paper.”
To the Finish Line 

NaNoWriMo began in 1999. That’s when founder Chris Baty woke up one day with the desire to write a novel. He had friends who also wanted to write novels. For a month, they challenged one another to reach their goal.
Grant Faulkner is NaNoWriMo’s executive director. He told TFK that the program “is a way to learn writing by having fun.” He says it’s not about creating a perfect novel. It’s about telling your story.
According to Sophia, NaNoWriMo helps writers overcome their fears. “What I realized along the way is that it’s okay to not quite make it. Or to feel afraid,” she says. “It’s getting your unique story out in a beautiful, messy  of words that counts.”

749,749,Should Halloween Be Moved to a Saturday?,"{'Debate', 'Opinion'}","
Jack-o’-lanterns, trick-or-treating, and all things eerie: It must be time for Halloween. This spooky celebration takes place each year on October 31. But in 2018, a petition was started to change that. Tens of thousands of people signed it. The petition, created by the Halloween & Costume Association, argued that the holiday should be moved to the last Saturday of October.
The petition has changed since then. Now, it seeks to establish a special Saturday trick-or-treat event and keep Halloween where it is. But the original petition got us wondering: Should Halloween be moved to a Saturday? We asked two TFK Kid Reporters to weigh in.
Yes!

by Priscilla L. Ho, 11
Glendale, California
Moving Halloween to the last Saturday of October would benefit kids and parents. Kids would have more time to celebrate. Parents wouldn’t have to worry about their kids’ bedtimes or homework. Instead, the whole family could sleep in on Sunday morning.
Halloween is fun, but it has its dangers. A study was published in JAMA Pediatrics in 2018. It said that from 1975 to 2016, pedestrians had a 43% greater chance of being in a fatal traffic accident on Halloween than on nights near that date. There’d be less work traffic on a Saturday. More parents could go trick-or-treating to ensure kids’ safety. 
Moving Halloween to a weekend would also mean more parades. It’d make the holiday relaxing, safe, and fun.
No!

Rex, Georgia
Halloween is magical and exciting. Ask any kid what he or she looks forward to most during the year and I bet Halloween will be on the list. You can eat candy and hang out with friends on any night, but Halloween is special. Why? 
Halloween has its roots in different historical traditions, all of which are linked to October 31. That date is what gives Halloween its value and importance. If Halloween were celebrated on a different date, it would lose its magic and mystery. 
Even though Halloween has changed over the years, we need to respect its long history. If people were to celebrate Halloween on a date other than October 31, the holiday just wouldn’t be as sweet.

753,753,Hope for Tigers,"{'Animals', 'World'}","
In 2010, the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) issued bad news: The world tiger population had hit an all-time low.  and habitat loss had taken their toll. In just 10 years, half of the world’s tigers had disappeared. Only 3,200 wild tigers remained. 
Now there’s good news: Tigers may be making a comeback. There are about 4,000 wild tigers worldwide. In July, India announced that its tiger population had reached nearly 3,000. That’s a 30% rise in just four years. India now has 70% of the world’s wild tigers. 
Prime Minister Narendra Modi is proud of his country’s efforts to save tigers. “Once the people of India decide to do something,” he says, “there is no force that can prevent them from getting the desired results.” 

Keeping a Promise
India’s government passed the Wildlife Protection Act in 1972. Tigers were covered under the law. Still, habitat loss was causing them to disappear. By 2006, there were just 1,411 tigers left in India. So the government committed to an even stronger plan. 
In 2010, India and 12 other countries made a pledge. They promised to double their tiger populations by 2022. The animal’s fate depends on these countries reaching that goal.
Nilanga Jayasinghe works for the WWF. “We have made significant strides in tiger conservation,” she told TIME for Kids. “But the threats to tigers remain. All 13 range countries need to work together to secure a future for tigers.”

Challenges Ahead
To count India’s tigers, wildlife trackers and scientists covered 150,000 square miles of tiger habitat. They used thousands of cameras to record the animal’s movements. This data has helped India create areas called . There, tigers can spread out and hunt. India has about 50 reserves.
Sometimes, tigers wander. That’s when trouble starts. The tigers may encounter people or . India’s government has been moving villages farther from reserves. This is to protect livestock from hungry tigers. It can also prevent villagers from killing tigers out of fear or for revenge.

Most people are willing to move. In India, “there is a lot of national pride surrounding tigers,” says Shari Rodriguez. She is a wildlife expert at Clemson University, in South Carolina. “We cannot save wildlife without the cooperation of the people.”
But challenges remain for tigers all over Asia. They are poached for their skin. Their whiskers and teeth are sold as medicine in China. “They’re still in peril,” Rodriguez says. She draws hope from India’s success: “This is a small, small victory in a long war against extinction.”

A Big Goal
Most of the tiger’s historical range is gone. So India and 12 other countries have boosted conservation efforts. India, Bhutan, Nepal, and Russia have increased their tiger populations. The WWF is working to bring tigers back in Cambodia. The cat was declared extinct there in 2016.

They also tried to be witty as they responded to their fellow candidates, throwing in some “dad jokes” and a reference to The Wizard of Oz. 

On the issue of health care, candidates Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders support Medicare for All. This means the United States government would provide health care to all Americans. It’s about “making sure that we have the most efficient way possible to pay for health care for everyone in this country,” Warren said. 
All candidates voiced support for stricter gun laws. Candidate Beto O’Rourke has spoken out strongly for gun control since a deadly shooting in El Paso, Texas. That’s his hometown. A debate moderator asked O’Rourke if he’s considering taking away people’s guns. “I am,” O’Rourke replied. “If it’s a weapon that was designed to kill people on a battlefield.”
Many college students attended the debate. I spoke to some of them. “It’s important to know what and who you are voting for,” college student Rebecca Artaugh told me. Another attendee, Jackson Stiles, added, “This debate is really critical. With 10 people on one stage, it is important at this point to see who is going to get cut out.” 

I also talked to Tom Perez. He is chair of the Democratic National Committee. I asked Perez what impact the debate will have on young people. “It will bring out the new generation,” he said.
After the debate, I asked candidate Kamala Harris what advice she has for today’s youth. Her response? “Never wait to ask for permission to lead. You just lead.” That’s exactly what these candidates are doing. In an America divided on many issues, they are leading by defending their opinions.

The candidates who participated in the debate were:
Joe Biden, former vice president of the United StatesCory Booker, senator from New JerseyPete Buttigieg, mayor of South Bend, IndianaJulián Castro, former secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban DevelopmentKamala Harris, senator from CaliforniaAmy Klobuchar, senator from MinnesotaBeto O’Rourke, former representative from TexasBernie Sanders, senator from VermontElizabeth Warren, senator from MassachusettsAndrew Yang, entrepreneur

761,761,Rebuilding History,"{'Places', 'World'}","
April 15, 2019, began like any other day in Paris, France. But everything changed when a fire broke out at Notre-Dame . Onlookers gasped as a piece of the country’s history went up in flames.
Maddie Shenkan, 15, lived right near the cathedral at the time. Smoke from the fire crept into her family’s home. She began seeing news articles and tweets online about the disaster. “It was so ,” Maddie told TIME for Kids. “Already, the whole world was watching.”

What History Deserves
Notre-Dame is an  Roman Catholic church. It stands on an island in the Seine River. Construction began about 850 years ago and took nearly 200 years. Today, Notre-Dame is one of the world’s finest examples of Gothic architecture. It’s known for its towering arches, pointed spires, and spooky .

To the people of France, Notre-Dame is much more than a place of worship. It is a symbol of the country. “It is our history,” said French president Emmanuel Macron on the night of the fire. “We will rebuild Notre-Dame,” he pledged, “because that is what our history deserves.” 
Macron called for Notre-Dame to be rebuilt by 2024. He wanted it to look more modern. But many wanted Notre-Dame to look exactly as it had before the fire. The French Senate agreed. On May 27, it voted to restore Notre-Dame to its “last known visual state” before the fire. 

A New Chapter
The restoration is just beginning. Already, there have been setbacks. Summer heat caused the ceiling to become too dry, and stones fell. Also, the blaze released toxic lead into the air. This delayed cleanup. Lead poisoning is still a concern.  

Experts are worried about Notre-Dame’s fragile framework, too. “The structure has been weakened by the fire,” says Michel Picaud. He is head of the charity Friends of Notre-Dame de Paris. “We have to secure the building before we can rebuild,” he says. This means cleaning, protecting, and repairing what has been damaged. 
The actual rebuilding will likely not begin until spring 2020. Workers from around the globe will come together to make it happen. Limestone will need to be carved. It will be used to rebuild Notre-Dame’s walls. Thousands of oak trees will be harvested. They will be used to reconstruct the roof. 

This isn’t the first time Notre-Dame has needed major repair. It has survived other fires. It was also damaged during the French Revolution. Over the centuries, it has  and been reshaped. 
Hundreds of years from now, people will look back at the 2019 Notre-Dame fire. What will they think? “I would like people to remember,” says Picaud, “that Notre-Dame de Paris began a new chapter in its story.”
The Damage Done

Five hundred firefighters put out the blaze at Notre-Dame. It took them about nine hours. By then, the cathedral’s 300-foot spire had collapsed. Nearly two-thirds of the roof was destroyed. But firefighters managed to save many important artifacts. One is a crown of thorns believed to have been worn by Jesus. Notre-Dame’s stained-glass windows and pipe organ also survived.

762,762,TFK Explains: Hong Kong Protests,"{'Government', 'World'}","
It has been more than three months since protests started in Hong Kong. Here, TFK explains.
Why did the protests begin?
On June 9, hundreds of thousands of people joined a march. They did it to  a bill. The bill would have made  legal in Hong Kong. That means people could be sent from Hong Kong to mainland China to be tried in court. Protesters worried that China would use extradition to punish people who speak out against the Chinese government. Protesters wanted the bill withdrawn. They demanded that Hong Kong’s leader, Chief Executive Carrie Lam, leave her job. 
What is Hong Kong’s relationship with China?
Hong Kong was once a colony of the United Kingdom. In 1997, it was returned to China under a special policy. The policy is called “one country, two systems.” This means Hong Kong is part of China, but it has its own courts and government.
But Hong Kong is not a full democracy. Many of its leaders are not elected by citizens. For instance, Lam was appointed by a committee that is loyal to the Chinese government. People in Hong Kong want this system changed.

Why have protests continued?
Protesters are committed to their cause. At a June 12 march, police fired tear gas and rubber bullets. Lam put the extradition bill on hold. But she did not withdraw it completely. Protesters were not satisfied. They demanded an investigation into police actions. They wanted protesters who had been arrested to be released. Again, they called for open elections and for Lam to leave her job.
Since then, demonstrations have grown. They have blocked roads. They have shut down the airport. Most have been peaceful. Some have turned violent. “It is going to be a long battle . . . to fight for our democracy,” says activist Joshua Wong.
How have the two governments responded?
Lam officially withdrew the extradition bill on September 4. Protesters say they will continue demonstrating. They say they won’t stop until all their demands are met.
Some fear that China’s leaders will use military force to stop the protests. More likely, they are waiting for protesters to give up. For now, China is standing firm. In a speech, President Xi Jinping said, “On matters of principle, not an inch will be yielded.”

763,763,On the Ball,"{'Science', 'Sports'}","
Major League Baseball (MLB) has a home-run problem. The number of home runs increased sharply in 2015 and has continued to rise. In 2017, batters hit 6,105 homers, setting a new record. This year’s number will be even higher. Batters have already hit more than 5,500 home runs.
But more homers means fewer balls in play, and for many fans, that means less-exciting games. So what’s going on? Some people wonder if the balls are being made differently so they’ll fly farther. The league says this isn’t happening.
One thing is certain: Something is different about the ball. “We don’t know exactly what yet,” says physicist Alan Nathan. He’s part of a team of 10 experts studying the baseball problem. Nathan doesn’t think the ball was changed on purpose. “Whatever the answer is, it’s something very ,” he says.
Spin Matters
The experts set out to solve the mystery by testing baseballs used since 2015. They took some apart and looked inside. They fired others from an air cannon to see how fast the balls flew. 
The experts also tested for bounce. The more bounce a ball has, the faster it leaves the bat and the farther it flies. But bounce tests showed consistency between the balls. 
Then the experts tested the “drag” of the baseballs. As a ball spins through the air, the air pushes back. This causes drag, which slows down the ball’s spin. That can hold the ball back. 
Sure enough, drag had decreased over the years. Baseballs cut through the air more easily. So which feature of the ball has changed to reduce drag? The experts aren’t ready to say. 
Variations are bound to happen, Nathan says. Baseballs are handmade. No two are ever the same. MLB could decide to make a change. The ball could be made the way it was before 2015. Should MLB make baseballs more , like golf balls are? “You could do that,” Nathan says. “But then it wouldn’t be a baseball.”
Made to Order
By MLB rules, all game baseballs 
are made of a core of rubber or cork wrapped in yarn and a horse- or cowhide shell. are 5 to 5¼ ounces and 9 to 9¼ inches around.

764,764,Fakeout,"{'Engineering', 'Media Literacy'}","
Deepfakes are videos with visual or audio content that has been . They can make it seem as if the video’s subject is saying words he or she hasn’t actually spoken. Videos like these used to be made only by trained special-effects artists. Today, anyone with the right tools can make a good deepfake.
Deepfakes may be dangerous. People are worried they will be used to trick the public. Imagine if someone made a deepfake of a world leader or other powerful person. How would viewers know not to believe what they were seeing and hearing? 
Wael Abd-Almageed wants to answer that question. He leads a team of five other researchers at the University of Southern California.  Abd-Almageed and his team designed computer software. It can determine whether a video is a deepfake. The software uses artificial intelligence to search the video for clues. The clues tell the team if the subject’s face has been manipulated. “If there is  in the video, such as how the eyes and mouth move, we can spot it,” Abd-Almageed told TIME for Kids.
Don’t Be Fooled 
How can you avoid being fooled by a deepfake? Abd-Almageed has some advice. He says not to immediately trust a video that you see online. Research it first. He advises asking yourself, “Would this person actually say something like this?” Look into the video’s source, too. Who made it? Who posted it?
Abd-Almageed also says you should watch videos at a slower speed to spot inconsistencies. This is possible using the settings on most video platforms, such as YouTube. But he believes deepfakes will continue to become more advanced. “Every day, someone will create a better deepfake,” Abd-Almageed says. “We have to try to detect it.”

It was July 20, 1969. Astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin climbed out of the Apollo 11 lander. They stepped onto the  surface. The United States had beaten the Soviet Union in the race to put humans on the moon. 
Fifty years later, a new race is on. “Our team is excited to get back to the moon,” says Marshall Smith of NASA. But this time, there’s more competition. China is focusing on space travel. Private companies are building rockets, too.
Why go back to the moon? There are fortunes to be made. Space-based businesses add $350 billion to the world . And new technologies might be discovered. Space research may lead to advances in  and air-traffic control.
Plus, the moon has ice. Ice could be turned into oxygen for visiting astronauts. And it could be used to make rocket fuel. Ships could refuel on the moon before taking off for Mars.

Competing Nations
NASA wants to send the next man and the first woman to the moon by 2024. Will China get there sooner? In January, it became the first country to land a rover on the far side of the moon. “We are building China into a space giant,” said the rover’s designer, Wu Weiren. 
But the U.S. leads in rocketry know-how. NASA is building a rocket called the Space Launch System. It will carry a spacecraft called Orion to the Gateway orbiter (see sidebar, Space Base). From there, crews will take a lander on trips to the moon’s surface.

NASA’s budget is around $20 billion. President Donald Trump has asked Congress to add around $1½ billion. But public support for funding lunar projects isn’t there, says NASA’s Mark Kirasich. “We could fly more often with more funding if the nation wanted to fly more often,” he says.
The Newcomers
There’s plenty of money at Blue Origin. The company’s owner is the billionaire head of Amazon, Jeff Bezos. In May, he  plans for the Blue Moon lunar lander. Its anticipated launch date is 2024. “It’s time to go back to the moon,” Bezos says.

Another company, SpaceX, aims to launch Starship in 2021. This moon orbiter has room for 100 passengers. NASA’s Orion can hold only six people. 
SpaceX's founder is billionaire Elon Musk. He wants to put a permanent base on the moon. Still, he knows he has big historical boots to fill. ""Apollo 11 was one of the most inspiring things in all human history,” he says. “I’m not sure SpaceX would exist if not for Apollo 11.""

Space Base
Think of Gateway as a base camp for exploring the moon. Gateway will serve as a home for astronauts. It will travel in an egg-shaped orbit around the moon. Astronauts will position Gateway over the spot they want to explore. Then they’ll take a lander down to the lunar surface.
NASA plans to send parts up to Gateway in uncrewed rockets. The space agency is eager to get Gateway built by 2024. The orbiter will allow people to explore more of the moon than they ever could on the Apollo missions.

Most hit songs follow a formula set by the music industry. But streaming and social media have changed this. Rising stars can now find fans without support from the music industry. 
No one understands this better than Lil Nas X. His first single is “Old Town Road.” It exploded online early this year. It’s been streamed more than a billion times since then. On July 29, it became the longest-running Number 1 song ever. 
But “Old Town Road” is more than that. The song combines hip-hop and country in a new way. And it became popular after Lil Nas X himself posted and  it online. “Everything lined up for this moment,” Nas told TIME. 
The Climb
To make “Old Town Road,” Lil Nas X studied popular songs. What  did they share? Bold beats. Catchy lyrics. Short length. In October 2018, Nas bought a weird banjo beat for $30. He mixed it with hip-hop elements and wrote lyrics.
Nas made more than a hundred videos to promote “Old Town Road.” He posted them online. Why? “If you see something going around the Internet, people want to join in,” he says. Millions of people put on cowboy outfits and danced to the song. “Old Town Road” began to climb the country music charts. 
Then something shocking happened. Billboard magazine banned the song from its Hot Country chart. It said the song didn’t sound enough like country music. Many people thought the song was banned because it came from outside the music industry. “People inside country music aren’t even paying attention to it,” said Kyle Coroneos, the founder of the website Saving Country Music.
But country music star Billy Ray Cyrus was paying attention. He helped Nas make a remix of the song. It shot to the top of the Billboard Hot 100 chart.
Lil Nas X is determined to make his success last. “It’s a good feeling,” he says.

On the afternoon of August 19, smoke and ash filled the sky over São Paulo, Brazil. The smoke was coming from the Amazon rain forest, hundreds of miles away. There, a record number of fires were raging, with little effort made to stop them. Some parts of the rain forest had been burning for several weeks. 
The Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais (INPE) is Brazil’s space research center. It uses satellites to monitor fires. On August 25, the INPE reported that it had spotted 80,626 fires in Brazil so far this year. That’s a 78% increase over the same period in 2018. It’s the most fires the INPE has seen in Brazil since it started tracking them in 2013. Many are in the Amazon.
 The fires sparked global . Protesters gathered in cities around the world. They demanded leaders take action. 

Global Crisis
The Amazon is the largest rain forest in the world. About 60% of it is in Brazil. The Amazon is home to millions of species of plants and animals and 30 million people. It is also important to the health of the planet. Its trees absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and replace it with oxygen. This helps slow . 

“Hundreds of thousands of acres of Amazon rain forest burning to the ground—that’s a real tragedy for the air we all breathe,” Moira Birss told TIME for Kids. She’s with Amazon Watch. It’s a  group based in California. 
Experts believe the fires were set on purpose. In general, it’s against the law to start a fire in the rain forest. But it’s not uncommon. Farmers regularly do so. They clear land so they can plant crops and raise cattle for beef production. 

Since 1978, some 289,000 square miles of the Amazon have been destroyed. That’s an area larger than the size of France. 
 peaked in the early 2000s. Then, in 2004, the Brazilian government began to crack down on illegal fires and logging. This greatly slowed tree loss in the region. 
But the new president of Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro, wants to reduce environmental protection. He took office in January 2019. Since then, Brazil has rolled back efforts to prevent deforestation. “We’ve had eight months without any type of  action in defense of the Amazon,” says Rômulo Batista. He’s with Greenpeace Brazil. 

Taking Action
Brazil has sent soldiers to battle the fires. It plans to send 44,000 troops to the area. On August 24, world leaders met for the annual Group of Seven (G7) summit. They agreed to a $20 million aid package to fight the blazes. But at press time, Bolsonaro would not accept the aid. On August 26, he tweeted that G7 leaders were treating Brazil as if it didn’t have the freedom to make its own decisions. 
G7 leaders also discussed a long-term plan to prevent deforestation and plant new trees in the Amazon. “The lung of our whole Earth is affected,” German leader Angela Merkel said at the summit, “and so we must find common solutions.”
How to Help
Here are three things you can do to help protect the Amazon.
Raise money for groups such as Rainforest Alliance and Amazon Watch. They’re working to raise awareness and change laws.Write letters. Share your opinions with politicians. Tell companies to make sure their practices don’t harm the environment. Take a look at your own habits. If we reduce the amount of meat we eat and paper we use, we can reduce deforestation.

Lego blocks spark children’s imagination. Now a new version of these toys is in the works. They’re called Lego Braille Bricks. They’re being tested around the world. Lego Braille Bricks can help people learn Braille. That’s a system of writing. In this system, raised dots stand for letters. People who are blind use their fingertips to read them. 
Worldwide, there are 36 million blind people. That’s according to the World Health Organization. It’s estimated that in the United States, only 10% of blind children learn Braille. Lego Braille Bricks can help change that. The knobs on the bricks are arranged as Braille letters. Blind children can use these knobs to learn Braille. Lego plans to launch the bricks next year. For some schools, they will be free. Along with the alphabet, the bricks will feature numbers and math symbols.
From Toy to Tool 
Thorkild Olesen is blind. He’s president of the Danish Association of the Blind. His group was one of the first to think of using Legos to teach Braille. Olesen says many teachers don’t have the tools to teach Braille. So they use  books instead.  
“Audio is great,” Olesen told TIME for Kids. “But it can never replace Braille. Braille is the single most important tool for us in order to learn to spell correctly, write, and gain literacy like sighted people.” 
Olesen’s group shared its idea for Braille Bricks with the Lego Foundation. That was in 2011. Olesen told the toy maker that the knobs on Legos are similar to Braille letters.

Stine Storm is a project manager at the Lego Foundation. She liked the idea of making Legos a learning tool. “It was an obvious match for us,” she says. The bricks will also have letters printed on them. This way, sighted and blind kids can play with the Legos together. “We all have to commit to making  a priority,” Storm says.

Picture this: You’re searching the Internet and come across a website. It has interesting articles. Some are news stories. They share information. Others only look like news stories. They are actually advertisements, or ads. The goal of an ad is to get you to buy something. How do you tell the difference between a news story and an ad? 
Back when I was growing up, it was easier. We got most of our information from newspapers. Big news stories appeared on the front page. Ads were boxed off and clearly labeled. But on the Internet, the two are often presented together. It can be hard to tell which is which. 
The research group I direct did a study. (MediaWise is a partnership between the Stanford History Education Group, the Poynter Institute, and the Local Media Association. We are funded by Google, and we addressissues.) We showed kids like you the home page of a popular digital magazine. We asked them to tell us what was a news story and what was an ad. 
Most were great at spotting certain types of ads. “It has a coupon code, a big company logo, and the words limited time offer,” one student wrote about an ad on the site. So where did kids get stumped? 
Some ads seem identical to news stories. They have headlines and present information. But they may also include the words sponsored content. Sponsored means “paid for.” Content refers to the information in the story. “Sponsored content” is a way of saying that something is an ad. Most kids, even if they used the Internet often, didn’t know this. 
As a reader, you have a right to know who’s behind the information you consume. So look for the phrase sponsored content. (And look carefully. Sometimes, it’s written in tiny letters.) The Internet is a vast sea of information. We must avoid the sharks. Learning to spot ads is an important step to becoming Internet-smart.

In Lalani of the Distant Sea, 12-year-old Lalani Sarita lives on the island of Sanlagita. Her life there doesn’t hold much more than mending fishing nets. When her mother gets sick, Lalani goes on a quest to a mysterious island to the north in hopes of securing a better future. Hardy sailors have made the same journey, but no one has returned. What hope does Lalani have?
Newbery Medal winner Erin Entrada Kelly told TFK that she wanted to show how “ordinary people can ignite change.” Lalani is a regular girl with no magical powers or abilities, but she cares deeply about her family and her people. She’s willing to do anything for them. “I wanted to explore the power of compassion,” says Kelly, “and the role it plays in a society built on fear and oppression.”

The Lion King was one of this summer’s biggest movies. Worldwide, it made over $1 billion. The movie is a remake of the 1994 animated film. But this version is different. It uses computers to create realistic images of the animal characters.
JD McCrary, 12, voices Simba as a cub. He says the filmmakers used virtual-reality technology to help cast members get into their roles. How? They gave actors a sneak peek at the movie’s computer-generated scenery. “Before I recorded most of the lines, I got to check out Pride Rock and the savanna,” JD told TIME for Kids. “It felt so real. That helped me get an image of what I would be doing.”
JD says he relates to Simba. “I’m not growing up to be a king or anything,” he says. “But I’m really trying to set my goals and set my priorities straight, kind of like he did.”

784,784,Forest on Fire,"{'Environment', 'World'}","
The Amazon rain forest is on fire. There are more fires burning there than ever before. That’s according to Brazil’s National Institute for Space Research. Using satellites to track  and wildfires, the agency has counted 74,155 fires in the Amazon this year. That’s roughly an 84% increase over last year at this time.
The effects of the fires are being felt across Brazil. Parts of the country are covered in smoke. In the state of São Paulo, heavy smoke caused the sky to go black and blocked the sun on Monday. Other Brazilian states have declared the situation an emergency. One state has been put on “environmental alert.”
Some people think the policies of  Brazil’s president, Jair Bolsonaro, have led to the increase in fires. He wants to change laws that protect the Amazon so businesses can clear more land for commercial use. Bolsonaro says the fires are blazing simply because “it is the season of the queimada.” (Queimada means “burned” in Portuguese. Portuguese is the official language of Brazil.)
But experts say Bolsonaro is wrong. They don’t blame the increase in fires on the season. They point to deforestation and a worldwide increase in temperatures. “Trees, if they’re stressed out by heat repeatedly, are more susceptible to other kinds of damage,” such as fires, says Deborah Lawrence. She’s an environmental sciences professor at the University of Virginia.
Carlos Nobre is a Brazillian climate scientist. He’s also an expert in tropical forests. The situation is “very sad,” according to Nobres. “We usually would see this surge of fire in very, very exceptionally dry years,” he says. “The fact that this record-breaking figure comes out in a relatively un-dry dry season shows that deforestation is increasing.”

785,785,Orbiting the Moon,"{'Science', 'Space'}","
On Tuesday, an uncrewed spacecraft called Chandrayaan-2 entered lunar orbit. India launched it about a month ago. Chandrayaan’s destination? The south pole of the moon. There, its rover will probe lunar craters for water deposits. If it gets to the surface intact, Chandrayaan will have achieved India’s first-ever moon landing. India would be just the fourth country to land there. The others are the United States, Russia, and China.
The chance of a successful landing is only 37%, Kailasavadivoo Sivan told reporters. He is the chairman of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). He said that when the craft finally lands, he will feel a mix of “happiness and tension and more anxiety.”
Chandrayaan means “moon craft” in the ancient language of Sanskrit. The ship’s lander will use rocket fuel to brake as it approaches the lunar surface on September 7. Artificial-intelligence technology will match the landing spot with a picture that has been loaded into Chandrayaan’s memory. On the ground, a rover will search the craters. ISRO believes 100 million tons of water could be hidden there.
Water could be used to make oxygen. This will be useful to future astronauts who are visiting the moon. “NASA has already announced the project of having human habitat . . . on the south pole,” Sivan said. “This [mission] will be giving input on a program which is concerning humanity in a major way.”
NASA will use Chandrayaan’s research to send people to the moon by 2024, Sivan said. “The globe is waiting for our data.”

787,787,Record-Breaking Heat,"{'Environment', 'World'}","
July 2019 was the hottest month ever recorded. That’s according to scientists at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). NOAA announced its findings on August 15. 
The average worldwide temperature for July was 62.1°F. That’s .05°F higher than July 2016, which had previously been the hottest month ever recorded. NOAA has been recording temperatures since 1880.
Scientists in Europe agree with NOAA’s findings. The Copernicus Climate Change Service, which focuses on monitoring temperatures there, released similar news earlier this month. Several European countries experienced record-breaking heat in July. 
Michael Allen, a climate scientist at Old Dominion University, spoke with TIME about the rise in temperatures. “If you put [together] all of the Julys for the last 20 or 40 or 100 years, there’s a clear trend upward,” he said. “That’s the concern—that long-term trend. Not a single day or single month in particular.”
This summer also saw many extreme weather events. Researchers say high temperatures are to blame. In Alaska, more than 2.4 million acres of land burned in wildfires. In Russia, more than 7 million acres burned. And, according to NOAA, Arctic sea ice melted to historic lows. 
Scientists say that  is one reason for this temperature increase. “Greenhouse gas pollution traps heat in the atmosphere, which has consequences,” said James Butler in May. He works for NOAA. “There’s no getting around it. Burning fossil fuels is changing the course of our planet’s future. How society deals with that will be a major challenge in coming decades.”
So far, 2016 remains the hottest full year on record. Scientists must wait to see how the second half of 2019 measures up.

789,789,Found: Monster Penguin,"{'Science', 'Animals'}","
Scientists announced the discovery of an extinct species of giant penguin on Wednesday. The bird’s fossilized bones have been found in New Zealand. 
Researchers believe the penguin stood about five feet two inches tall. That’s just a little bit shorter than the average adult woman. The penguin weighed about 176 pounds. The prehistoric bird would have stood a foot taller than and weighed twice as much as an emperor penguin. That’s the largest penguin alive today. 
The fossils were discovered by Leigh Love, an amateur fossil collector, in the bed of New Zealand’s Waipara River.
The monster penguin species is named Crossvallia waiparensis. Researchers believe the penguin lived around 60 million years ago, during the Paleocene Epoch. 
Paul Scofield is with the Canterbury Museum, in New Zealand. He studied the fossils. Scofield believes that penguins and other birds got bigger during the Paleocene Epoch. That’s because there weren’t many large predators around at the time. “The oceans were ripe for the picking with the lack of mega predators,” Scofield says. In New Zealand, scientists have discovered fossils of other huge birds. One such discovery was the world’s largest parrot.
The Crossvallia waiparensis is similar to a species of giant penguin that was discovered in Antarctica. Scofield says this finding could help prove there was once land connecting New Zealand and Antarctica.

Today, Greta Thunberg set sail for the United States. 
The 16-year-old climate activist is traveling across the Atlantic Ocean on a sailboat. She is heading for New York City. She will attend a United Nations climate-change summit there in September.  
Greta lives in Sweden. She refuses to fly because airplanes produce carbon emissions that harm the planet. Cruise ships are also big polluters. 
Last month, the team behind the Malizia II offered to bring Greta to the United States. The Malizia is a high-tech racing sailboat. It generates electricity using solar panels and underwater turbines. Greta hopes to create zero carbon emissions on her journey across the Atlantic. 
The 60-foot boat was designed for ocean races, not for comfort. It has no toilet or shower. Passengers will eat freeze-dried food. The trip is expected to last two weeks. 
""It's not very luxurious,"" Greta says. “It's not very fancy, but I don't need that. I need only a bed and just the basic things.”
Greta will be joined by her father and by a documentary filmmaker, who will record the trip. Two members of the boat’s team, Boris Herrmann and Pierre Casiraghi, will also be onboard. 
""It can be calm and smooth and going along, and you can read a book,” Herrmann says. “Or it can be really rough, and you hold on and try to fight seasickness and [it] can be really hard.""
Greta has become famous as the face of the youth movement for climate awareness. In August 2018, she began staging frequent sit-ins outside of Swedish parliament. Her efforts inspired climate-focused protests around the world. In March 2019, Greta was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. The winner will be announced in October. If Greta wins, she will become the youngest-ever recipient of the award.

At Sunday’s U.S. Gymnastics Championships, in Kansas City, Missouri, gymnast Simone Biles, 22, won her sixth national title. And she did it in her usual boundary-breaking style. She didn’t just win. She made history by becoming the first woman ever to perform a triple-double in the floor exercise of a competition. The triple-double is a double backflip with three twists. 
In fact, Biles landed two triple-doubles. The first was on Friday. But she had trouble with the landing and put her hands on the mat. She was determined to try again on Sunday. This time, she nailed it. 
“It’s like she hit a hole in one and we were all there,” said Tom Forster, the U.S.A. Gymnastics high-performance director. “It’s a big deal and we all know it. . . . She should be super excited about that.”
After finishing on Sunday with a routine on the uneven bars, Biles looked relieved. She gave her coach, Laurent Landi, a high five and hugged her competitors. She’d made up for the slight stumble on Friday.
“I was a lot happier today,” Biles said. “To finally do a good routine like I can do it, I was really happy.”
Over the course of the two-day meet, Biles earned a total of 118.500 points. Her score was nearly five points ahead of the second-place winner, 16-year-old Sunisa Lee.
Next on the record-setter’s agenda are the World Artistic Gymnastics Championships, in Germany, about two months away. And next year, Biles will go to the Olympics, where she is already a four-time gold medalist. The 2020 Summer Olympics will be held in Tokyo, Japan.

794,794,The Future of Food?,"{'Environment', 'World'}","
Climate change could soon drastically reduce the world’s food supply. That’s according to a report released Thursday by the United Nations. The report was created by a group of more than a hundred experts from 52 countries. 
Climate change has made drought, floods, and forest fires more common. It has transformed fertile land into desert. It has also contributed to species loss. 
According to the U.N. report, all these things will affect the food supply. They’ll make it more difficult to produce food. “The threat of climate change affecting people’s food on their dinner table is increasing,” says Cynthia Rosenzweig. Rosenzweig is a NASA climate scientist. She’s one of the report’s authors. 
Climate change has already caused the price of food to rise. And it has made some foods less nutritious. But Rosenzweig says there’s still hope. “There are a lot of actions that we can take now,” she says. 
The report urges consumers to reduce food waste. As much as 30% of the food produced worldwide is wasted. 
The report also urges consumers to eat less meat and more vegetables, seeds, and fruit. Producing those foods creates fewer of the harmful emissions that contribute to climate change. 
“We don’t want a message of despair,” says Jim Skea. Skea’s a U.N. science panel official. He’s also a professor at Imperial College London. “We want to get across the message that every action makes a difference.”

795,795,Best Job in the World,"{'Animals', 'World'}","
Meet Huang Shunjie. He might have the best job in the world. The 24-year-old is a panda photographer and zookeeper. Huang spends each day caring for 18 panda cubs at the Giant Panda Protection and Research Center, in China. He prepares their meals of bamboo and milk formula. He checks on their growth and health. And he carries these two-tone fluff-balls between their sleeping pens and their public enclosure.
The best part? “I can get very close to the baby pandas, which makes many people jealous,” Huang told TIME. “I get to hug them all the time.”
There are, of course, bad parts to any job. In Huang’s case, it’s the regular bites and scratches he gets from the 45- to 55-pound bears. But it’s a small price to pay to spend each day among the pandas’ roly-poly cuteness. They tumble around, balance on their heads, and bop around like furry toddlers. “I’m a full-time daddy for these fluffy baby pandas,” says Huang.

He-He and Mei-Mei
Two of the pandas Huang cares for are known worldwide. He-He and Mei-Mei celebrated their first birthday on July 25. They are the only twin pandas born from a wild father and captive mother. This helps widen the animal’s genetic pool, which means a better chance at survival. Pandas were among the world’s most threatened animals until recently.
“Mei-Mei is very cute and clingy,” says Huang. “But her brother is very naughty. He is one of the wild kids. He loves making trouble.”
Giant pandas are native to China. For many years, they were one of the world’s most endangered creatures. Their natural habitat, in bamboo forests, has been destroyed by construction. Pandas must eat 30 to 85 pounds of bamboo every day.
But populations have recovered in recent years. That’s thanks to programs to help pandas breed. Today, there are 1,864 pandas in the wild. That’s up from only 1,114 in the 1970s, according to China’s National Forestry and Grassland Administration. Two-thirds of them live in nature reserves.
Panda Diplomacy
As the number of pandas goes up, China is able to send more of them overseas. This is called “panda diplomacy.” It began in the seventh century, when China sent a pair of pandas to Emperor Tenmu, of Japan. Today, more than 50 pandas live in 18 countries.
Most famously, China sent a pair of pandas—Ling-Ling and Hsing-Hsing—to the United States after President Richard Nixon’s historic visit to China, in 1972. More recently, two pandas were sent to the Moscow Zoo, in Russia, just last month.
China usually sends pandas to other countries for 10 years. It charges about $1 million per year for the service. Any offspring remain China’s property. The loans often take place along with international trade deals that China’s involved in. But if a deal goes sour, China may take the pandas back.
Huang doesn’t think about money or politics, though. He thinks about the fact that the pandas he cares for end up bringing joy to millions of adults and children around the globe. “I’m really proud of that,” he says.

797,797,Hong Kong Protests Continue,"{'Government', 'World'}","
Protesters in Hong Kong gathered in large numbers on Monday. They staged demonstrations at shopping malls, at government offices, and on a major highway.
In many places, the protests grew chaotic. Dozens of people were arrested. Police officers released tear gas. They fired rubber bullets. In the city of Sha Tin, demonstrators set fire to a police station. The protests interrupted subway service. They caused more than 200 flights to be canceled. 
These clashes are the latest in nearly two months of unrest in Hong Kong. Protests began on June 9. Protesters were angry about a proposed law. The law would have made extradition legal in Hong Kong. That means people could be sent from Hong Kong to mainland China to stand trial. Protesters worried that Chinese officials would use this law against people in Hong Kong who act or speak out against the Chinese government. 
At first, protesters wanted the proposed law to be withdrawn. They also wanted the city’s top leader, Chief Executive Carrie Lam, to resign. But over the last few months, protesters’ demands have grown. Now they are calling for the city to investigate police misconduct. They also want protesters who have been sent to prison to be released. According to Hong Kong police, about 420 people have been arrested since protests began in June.
At a news conference on Monday, Lam said the extradition bill is “dead.” But she refused to quit her job. “This is the time for us to rally together,” Lam said. “To set aside differences and bring back order and say no to chaos and violence.”
Joseph Wong is the former head of Hong Kong’s civil service. Wong spoke to the New York Times. He said Lam could stop the violence by giving the protesters what they demand.
“The chief executive has the responsibility to set a good example by complying with the rule of law,” he said. “Many people doubt the chief executive herself is doing precisely what she keeps on preaching to the Hong Kong people.”

A team of paleontologists in France announced last week that they had uncovered the bone of one of the largest dinosaurs that ever lived. It is likely the thighbone, or femur, of a sauropod. Sauropods were plant-eating dinosaurs with long necks and tails. They lived during the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. 
The bone is 6 1/2 feet long and it weighs 1,102 pounds. That makes it taller than the average human and heavier than the average horse. 
Excavators unearthed the bone at a site in Angeac-Charente. That’s in southwestern France. The bone was covered in a thick layer of clay. Experts say the bone is 140 million years old. 
The bone was well-preserved. “We can see the insertions of muscles and tendons, and scars,”  Ronan Allain told Reuters. Allain is a paleontologist at the National Museum of Natural History in Paris. “This is rare for big pieces, which tend to collapse in on themselves and fragment.”
Many fossils have been discovered at the Angeac-Charente site, but this is the largest bone uncovered there so far. Experts and museum curators are especially excited about the dinosaur discovery. 
""This femur is huge! And in an exceptional state of conservation,” Jean-François Tournepiche told Le Parisien. Tournepiche is a curator at the Museums of Angoulême in Angoulême, France. “It's very moving,” he adds.

NASA’s new satellite, TESS, is succeeding on its mission. It has found new planets outside our solar system. TESS stands for Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite. It has discovered three planets in a solar system 73 light-years from Earth. That may seem far. But according to TIME’s Jeffrey Kluger, it’s “one town over on the scale of the universe.”
The planets orbit a dwarf star called TOI 270. (TOI stands for TESS object of interest.) The dwarf star acts like our sun, but it’s cooler and smaller. The planet closest to TOI 270 is called TOI 270 b. It’s probably a rocky planet. It’s also “oven-hot,” according to NASA. The atmosphere on TOI 270 b is around 490°F. 
The other two planets are gas planets. They are like smaller versions of Neptune. TOI 270 c and TOI 207 d are more than twice the size of Earth.
“This system is exactly what TESS was designed to find,” writes lead researcher Maximilian Günther at NASA’s website.
NASA launched TESS in 2018. Now it plans to build a telescope that can analyze the atmospheres of the planets TESS finds. If construction goes ahead, that telescope will be ready in 2021. TESS and the new telescope would help scientists study how planetary systems are formed. Using them, scientists would search for life beyond Earth.

“Congratulations #Ethiopia for not only meeting our collective #GreenLegacy goal but also exceeding it,” the prime minister tweeted on Monday. The original goal had been to plant 200 million trees that day.
Other countries and groups have taken on similar efforts. In 2017, volunteers in India planted 66 million trees in 12 hours. Australia plans to plant a billion trees by 2030. The African Union, a group of 55 African countries, is building a “Great Green Wall” of trees to stop the spread of the Sahara desert.
Earlier this year, Swiss scientists released a new report. It appeared in the journal Science. The report says that planting 1.2 trillion trees around the world could help absorb carbon emissions, which pollute the air. Trees use carbon dioxide to grow. They store the carbon in their leaves. This removes it from the air.
It will take time for these trees to grow. It can take decades of growth for trees to capture carbon .

Jesselyn shows constant strength, determination, and passion for her sport, even when it feels like the universe is telling her no. She breaks down gender stereotypes and provides a positive role model for other girls. 
I would recommend this book to anybody and everybody. It has a captivating plot. Jesselyn’s story shows that the greatest and most precious things in life—like family and integrity—are more important than winning and success.
Everyone can benefit from reading about Jesselyn’s down-to-earth nature and logical approach to stressful situations. I enjoyed the story line and appreciate the book’s message. My Corner of the Ring is a story of feminism, bravery, and passion in a male-dominated sport.

804,804,Feeling Invisible,"{'Books', 'Time Off'}","
Willa Grover likes to read, likes routines, loves dogs, hates slimy food. She has a wonderful best friend, Ruby, who’s in her class at school. But in Not If I Can Help It, Willa’s life is turned upside down when her dad starts dating Ruby’s mom. 
Eleven-year-old Willa also has sensory processing disorder. The disorder is different for every person who has it. It makes Willa very sensitive to certain things that she touches, hears, or tastes. She is even sensitive to sudden surprises or changes in plans. She feels “invisible weird” because people can’t see her disability.
Author CAROLYN MACKLER told TIME for Kids she was inspired by her son. He was diagnosed with sensory processing disorder as a toddler. Mackler has struggled to find stories her son could relate to. So she decided to write one.
“I really wanted [her disorder] to be a part of who Willa is—but it doesn’t define her story,” Mackler says. “Having a disability doesn’t define who you are. You’re still a person who has other stories.”

805,805,Puerto Rico’s Governor Resigns,"{'United States', 'Government'}","
The governor of Puerto Rico, Ricardo Rosselló, will resign from office on August 2. His announcement comes after two weeks of mass protests on the island. Residents have been demanding that Rosselló step down. 
Rosselló announced the decision in a Facebook post late Wednesday night. “The demands have been overwhelming,” he said. “I’ve received them with highest degree of humility.” 
Protests began on July 13. They were sparked by the release of private messages between the governor and people who work with him. Puerto Ricans felt the messages were offensive to women and gay people. In one exchange, a government official joked about victims of Hurricane Maria. Nearly 3,000 people may have died as a result of the hurricane, in 2017. Large parts of the island were without power for months. 
To many Puerto Ricans, the messages represented decades of government corruption. Even before the protests started, several officials were accused of breaking laws. “It was so insulting,” Milagros Concepcion told TIME. She flew from New York to Puerto Rico’s capital, San Juan, to join the protests on Monday. “People are just so mad because [Rosselló] took advantage of our people.” 
Puerto Rico is a territory of the United States. It’s under U.S. control but is not a state. Its citizens can vote in local elections, but they cannot vote for U.S. president. They’re not represented in the U.S. Congress in the same way as other citizens. 
Rosselló will be the island’s first leader to resign. After his announcement, the people of Puerto Rico celebrated with cheering, singing, and fireworks. Justice secretary Wanda Vázquez will take his place.

806,806,Kids Who Care,"{'United States', 'Government'}","
WASHINGTON, D.C. — Huck Paisley, 12, and rising pop star Rita Angel Taylor, 11, are busy kids, to say the least. When they’re not attending conferences or filming music videos, they’re fighting for what they believe in. Huck and Rita work alongside a charity group called CARE to help end global poverty. CARE stands for Cooperative for Assistance and Relief Everywhere. This is just a fancy way of saying they help people around the world!
Last week, Huck and Rita went to Washington, D.C., to meet with senators and representatives on Capitol Hill, including Senator Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee and Representative Will Hurd of Texas. Why? Huck and Rita want lawmakers to protect aid to foreign countries. They want to make sure that U.S. aid is available for kids in need around the world. On Capitol Hill, they went from office to office with their mothers, sharing their eye-opening experiences in Peru and Guatemala. The two have seen firsthand what CARE is doing overseas. 
Rita recounted that when she visited Peru, “some of the girls had to walk five or more hours to school.” However, CARE had set up a cabin for these girls to stay in during the week, which makes the distance much shorter. 
Huck spoke to members of Congress about a kid who was a shoe shiner. “He couldn’t go to school,” Huck said. “[Going to school] should be his job.”
CARE was founded in 1945. Last year, the group was active in more than 90 countries. It focuses on educating women and girls. Joel Goldman is CARE’s executive director of entertainment industry strategy and relations. He was with Huck and Rita in Washington, D.C. Goldman says that when women are empowered, they lift everyone else up with them.

807,807,Trick or Treat for All,"{'Business', 'Holidays'}","
Large retail stores are already gearing up for Halloween. But many of the costumes they sell aren’t suitable for everyone. Children with disabilities often have a hard time finding costumes that fit their needs. 
One big brand is doing its part to change that. Last week, Target announced that it will be offering four new Halloween costumes. They are made just for kids with disabilities. 
Two costumes are designed for children who use wheelchairs. One is a princess dress. The other is a pirate outfit. Both come with a matching wheelchair cover. One turns the chair into a carriage, the other a pirate ship. The covers “can easily be cut to fit a variety of wheelchair sizes,” according to the Target website. Target may be the first large retailer to make costumes that are wheelchair-friendly.
The store is also offering costumes for kids with sensory sensitivity. Target’s unicorn and shark outfits don’t have seams or tags. These can be itchy for kids with sensitive skin. These small changes could make a big difference for many people. “Design details can have a huge impact,” a Target spokesperson told the Independent. 
On Twitter, people are welcoming Target’s effort. “I wish more companies embraced people with #disabilities,” one user posted. “Thank you for knowing people with disabilities are your customer[s] too.” Many hope Target’s actions will inspire other companies to be more inclusive.

808,808,TFK Reads: Greystone Secrets: The Strangers,"{'Books', 'Time Off'}","
Greystone Secrets: The Strangers is the first book in a new series from author Margaret Peterson Haddix. The story opens with a mystery, and takes many twists and turns as it races toward a conclusion.
The Strangers is one of TFK’s 10 recommended reads for this summer. After we made our picks, we handed them off to our team of TFK Kid Reporters to get their take. Here, TFK Kid Reporter Tiana Sirmans shares her review.
We’ll be posting reviews each Tuesday, all summer long. Check back next week to read about My Corner of the Ring, by Jesselyn Silva.

The Strangers is about three siblings named Finn, Emma, and Chess Greystone. One day, they come home from school and see a news report about three kidnapped children from Arizona. 
The kidnapped children, whose last name is Gustano, look like the Greystone kids. And they have the same first and middle names, ages, and birth dates as the Greystones. 
Then the Greystone kids’ mom also goes missing. The story follows Finn, Emma, and Chess on their journey to find their mother and the Gustano kids. 
I think kids, tweens, teens, and anyone who likes a good mystery would enjoy this book. I would rate The Strangers a 10 out of 10. A complete 10! It took me through so many emotional moments as I read it. I was happy, sad, nervous, and excited. I can’t wait to read it again!

809,809,Baseball’s Class of 2019,"{'United States', 'Sports'}","
Mariano Rivera stepped to the podium and the crowd chanted his name. The retired New York Yankee spoke in both English and Spanish to the 55,000 people who turned out in Cooperstown, New York, on Sunday. It was the second-largest crowd ever for a National Baseball Hall of Fame induction ceremony.
And it was a historic occasion. Rivera is the first player to win the unanimous vote of the Baseball Writers’ Association of America. During his remarks, he hardly looked down at the speech he’d written. “Sometimes, you write words and it doesn't sound right,"" he said. ""But when you come from the heart, it comes right. My intention was always to speak from the heart.""
Rivera pitched 19 seasons with the New York Yankees, from 1995 to 2013. He helped the team win five World Series. And he played on Major League Baseball’s all-star team 13 times. Yet Rivera didn’t always dream of playing baseball. As a child growing up in Panama, he idolized the Brazilian soccer legend Pelé. But he found his home on the mound.  
""You're special for me,"" Rivera told the crowd in Cooperstown. ""Thank you for your help. Latin American fans, thank you. Thank you for loving me. I'm so humbled and blessed to receive this incredible honor.""
There were five other inductees on Sunday: pitchers Roy Halladay, Mike Mussina, and Lee Smith; slugger Edgar Martinez; and outfielder Harold Baines, who capped a 22-year career with his induction into the Hall of Fame. 
The National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum opened in Cooperstown in 1939. It serves as a museum of baseball history and a research library. Every year, players are inducted into the Hall of Fame by baseball journalists. The first inductees included Babe Ruth and Ty Cobb.

The Lion King is about Simba, a young lion prince. Simba must overcome tragedy and take his rightful place as the king of Pride Rock. Along the way, he escapes ferocious hyenas, makes new friends, and faces his uncle in battle. 
This new movie is a remake of the 1994 animated film. The story remains much the same. But this version uses computers to create realistic images of the animal characters. 
JD MCCRARY, 12, voices Simba as a cub. He says the filmmakers used virtual-reality technology to put cast members in the movie’s computer-generated scenery. “Before I recorded most of the lines, I got to check out Pride Rock and the savanna,” he told TIME for Kids. “It felt so real. That helped me get an image of what I would be doing.”
JD says he relates to Simba. “I'm not growing up to be a king or anything,” he says. “But I'm really trying to set my goals and set my priorities straight, kind of like he did.” 
The Lion King roars into theaters today.

811,811,A Curious Porcupine,"{'Community', 'Animals'}","
Visitors to the Seashore Trolley Museum in Kennebunkport, Maine, expected to see a collection of historic streetcars. On Tuesday, they got an additional, unexpected treat.
A rare albino porcupine scuttled across the museum’s lawn. At first, museumgoers misidentified the fluffy critter.
“We were guessing that it was a skunk, so we didn’t want to get too close to it,” Katie Orlando, the museum’s executive director, told TIME for Kids. 
A brave museum volunteer got close enough to take photos. Orlando posted them on Facebook, asking people to help her identify the mystery creature. “Our first guess was albino skunk, but now we are thinking albino groundhog,” she wrote.
Facebook users, including some who are wildlife experts, agreed that the animal was an albino porcupine. They also agreed that it was a baby, with a furry coat that would eventually harden into quills. 
Porcupine sightings are common in Maine. But albino porcupines? Not so much. Albinism is a rare genetic condition. It causes a lack of melanin in the body. The lack of melanin is what causes the baby porcupine to be totally white. Researchers say that only one out of every 10,000 mammals born is a true albino.
The museum’s surprise visitor explored the lawn until well after closing time.
“We’re not sure if he’ll come back,” says Orlando. “But if he does, we’ll definitely enjoy seeing him again. And we’ll do our best to keep him safe from predators—and from curious humans.”

812,812,More Heat Waves?,"{'Environment', 'Science'}","
People across the country have been sweating through heat waves this summer. New research suggests they should get used to it.
Why? Climate change may make extreme heat conditions more common in almost every part of the country. This is according to a new paper. It was published on Tuesday, in the journal Environmental Research Communications. The paper says that by the end of the century, parts of the southeastern U.S. could have more than 120 days per year that feel hotter than 100°F. This includes states such as Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida.
Researchers from the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) led the study. UCS is a nonprofit organization. It uses science as a basis for talking about problems such as climate change and . 
The National Weather Service (NWS) has a system called a heat index. It uses air temperature and humidity to determine how hot it really feels outside. This is how the NWS decides to warn people of extreme heat. They issue a heat advisory when the heat index is expected to hit at least 100°F for two days or more. 
What will happen in the Pacific Northwest and northern New England? These areas tend to be cooler. But they could also be affected, the study says. These places could see up to 10 days a year with a heat index of 105°F.
Extreme heat can be dangerous. Being exposed to high temperatures for a long period of time can lead to health risks. One risk is dehydration. Another is heat stroke.

813,813,Caught on Tape,"{'History', 'Space'}","
Three reels of videotape from NASA’s Apollo 11 mission will be sold at Sotheby’s auction house on Saturday, July 20. That’s the moon landing’s 50th anniversary. 
Sotheby’s says the videos are “the only surviving first-generation recordings of the historic moon walk.” The footage shows “unrestored, unenhanced, and unremastered” images of Neil Armstrong’s first steps on the moon. It also shows the astronauts planting an American flag. 
Bidding on the tapes will start at $700,000. Sotheby’s estimates that their sale price will be from $1 million to $2 million.
The tapes are owned by Gary George, a former NASA intern. George purchased the footage at a government auction in 1976. He paid just $218, or about $975 in today’s dollars. For decades, George didn’t know the contents of the tapes. He didn’t think they included anything of value. He had hoped to sell them to TV stations.
It wasn’t until 2006 that George realized what he had. The footage has reportedly been viewed only three times since 1976. Other, clearer recordings were probably reused or erased at NASA in the early 1980s.
The tapes will headline a Sotheby’s auction dedicated to space exploration.

This week marks the 50th anniversary of the launch of Apollo 11. That’s the NASA mission that first landed people on the moon. In the graphic novel Rocket to the Moon!, Don Brown tells the story of the mission in words and illustrations. 
Rocket to the Moon! is one of TFK’s 10 recommended reads for summer. After we made our picks, we handed them off to our team of TFK Kid Reporters to get their take. Here, TFK Kid Reporter Minoo Jang shares his review.
We’ll be posting reviews each week, all summer long. Check back next Tuesday to read about Greystone Secrets: The Strangers, by Margaret Peterson Haddix.

Rocket to the Moon! is a historical graphic novel. It recounts the story of NASA’s Apollo space program. It also looks closely at the Apollo 11 mission. That was the mission that first landed a person on the moon, on July 20, 1969. 
Spending a mere couple of pages on pre–20th century rocketry, Rocket to the Moon! does more summarizing than storytelling. From the invention of gunpowder in China to the moon race between the U.S. and Soviet Union, this book shows what made the Apollo 11 mission possible. 
Don Brown’s book offers attention-grabbing facts. And it has strong visual appeal. The novel’s pictures present the Apollo 11 mission in a way that is easy to understand.
Although the plot feels more focused on rockets than on people and their stories, the art and historical information make this graphic novel interesting. Kids who want to learn more about space exploration would like this book.

On July 16, 1969, the Apollo 11 spacecraft blasted off from Cape Kennedy (now Cape Canaveral), in Florida. Four days later, Apollo’s lunar module landed at its destination. When Neil Armstrong emerged, he made history as the first person to walk on the moon. 
Next week marks 50 years since the moon landing. To celebrate, TIME for Kids created this list of new books about Apollo 11. Check them out and be transported to another time and place. 


Flying to the Moon: An Astronaut’s Story 
By Michael Collins
Michael Collins was the pilot on Apollo 11. While Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong walked on the moon, Collins stayed on Columbia, the mission’s command module. For more than 21 hours, he orbited the moon alone. In Flying to the Moon, Collins tells his story. The book was originally published in 1976, and was rereleased for the 50th anniversary of Apollo 11. This new version includes a foreword by astronaut Scott Kelly. 
Reaching for the Moon

Reaching for the Moon is an autobiography by NASA mathematician Katherine Johnson. When the book opens, Johnson is 4 years old and helping her older brother with his math homework. “Math had always come easily to me,” she writes. “I loved numbers and numbers loved me.” Eventually, Johnson goes to work for NASA. There, she performs many of the complex calculations that make important space missions possible, including Apollo 11.

Vatnajökull National Park, in Iceland. Ancient Babylonian ruins, in Iraq. The buildings of architect Frank Lloyd Wright in the United States. These and 26 other additions were made to the UNESCO World Heritage List last weekend during the group’s annual meeting.
UNESCO is the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization. The group meets each year to decide what places to add to its list of world wonders. According to its website, UNESCO requires a place to be “of outstanding universal value” in order to be considered. It must also meet at least one of 10 criteria. These include natural, cultural, and historical reasons a site could be deemed important.

The UNESCO World Heritage List began in 1978. It now has 1,121 entries. The sites are in 167 countries. Being named to the list can bring money and tourism to a site. It also can bring attention to places that are environmentally important, such as the habitats of endangered plants and animals.
Mechtild Rössler is the director of UNESCO’s World Heritage Center. That is in Paris, France. She says the organization hopes to bring more diversity to the list. “There is an imbalance,” Rössler told the New York Times. “We have a very high number of nominations from countries in Europe, and no or few nominations from Africa.” Only one of the 29 sites added to the list this year is in Africa.

818,818,What's a Ticker-Tape Parade?,"{'Places', 'History'}","
The World Cup–winning United States Women’s National Soccer Team was honored in a ticker-tape parade today in New York City. The athletes rode up a stretch of Broadway called the Canyon of Heroes to City Hall. There, the mayor presented them with a ceremonial key to the city. The crowd cheered for the players and proudly waved American flags. 
But what’s a ticker-tape parade, anyway?
Ticker-tape parades celebrate heroes and important events. New York City has held  more than 200 ticker-tape parades since the first, in 1886. That parade was to honor the Statue of Liberty’s dedication. Since then, ticker-tape parades have been thrown for many different reasons. They have recognized astronauts, world leaders, and soldiers coming home from war. Ticker-tape parades have also taken place after athletic victories. These have included the Olympics, the Super Bowl, and the World Series.
During early ticker-tape parades, people tossed tiny strips of paper out of their office windows as the parade passed by. These strips were called ticker tape. That’s because they were used in ticker-tape machines. The machines printed up-to-the-minute news and information about the stock market. They made a tick-tick-tick sound as they worked.

Ticker-tape machines are no longer used. Newer technologies, such as television and computers, provide stock information. At ticker-tape parades, people now toss confetti made from recycled paper. Like ticker tape, these bits of paper swirl through the air, adding to the excitement of the parade. 
And afterward? A second group of heroes appears, brooms in hand: The clean-up crew!

819,819,California Quakes,"{'United States', 'Earth Science'}","
Two major earthquakes hit Southern California last week. The first struck on July 4, near the Mojave Desert. Its magnitude was 6.4. There were small tremors afterward, called aftershocks. On July 5, the second earthquake hit. With a magnitude of 7.1, it was the biggest quake to strike the state in nearly 20 years.
The effects could be felt in Las Vegas, Nevada; Los Angeles, California; and parts of Mexico. But the town of Ridgecrest, California, was closest to the center of the earthquakes. There, the quakes damaged roads, blocked railroad tracks, and caused fires. No deaths or major injuries have been reported. 
April Hamlin lives in Ridgecrest. She was home when the second quake hit. At first, her family thought it was another aftershock, she told TIME. “But it just kept on intensifying,” she says.
Earthquakes occur when rock layers in the Earth’s crust suddenly push past each other. This happens along a fault, which is the place where the two plates meet. Earthquakes can cause major damage in urban areas. Many people are relieved that the recent California quakes didn’t happen in or near a big city, such as Los Angeles or San Diego. 
The Hayward Fault is in Northern California, in the East Bay region. This part of the state is home to more than 2 million people. According to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), there could be a damaging earthquake along the Hayward Fault in the next 30 years. The USGS and its partners work to inform the public of what could happen if a devastating earthquake occurs. They do this so city officials and citizens can prepare.
Jennifer Strauss works at the Berkeley Seismology Lab, in Northern California. She says it’s important for California residents to be aware of the effects of high-magnitude earthquakes. These include road damage and power outages. Awareness will help people “be better equipped to ride it out,” she told TIME. “Don’t be fearful, but be empowered.”

Other Words for Home is a novel in verse, or a book-length poem that tells a story. It’s about a Syrian refugee who’s trying to build a new life in a place where most people don’t look like her. 
Other Words for Home is one of TFK’s 10 recommended reads for summer. After we made our picks, we handed them off to our team of TFK Kid Reporters to get their take. Here, TFK Kid Reporter Belle Irby shares her review.
We’ll be posting reviews each week, all summer long. Check back next Tuesday to read about Rocket to the Moon!, by Don Brown. 

Other Words for Home is about a 12-year-old girl named Jude who escapes the war in Syria by moving to the United States. Jude must leave behind her father, brother, and friends. In the U.S., Jude and her mother settle in Cincinnati, Ohio. They live with relatives there. 
Jude tries to adapt to her new family, school, and community, though it’s difficult. She also faces prejudice. People stereotype Jude based on her appearance and her background. 
But Jude challenges herself to be brave by trying out for a role in the school play. She gets the role, which gives her hope for a brighter future. Eventually, she makes new friends and begins to feel more at home in her new country. 
Other Words for Home is written in verse. It’s a great read for those who enjoy poetry. The book will also resonate with people who have faced and overcome challenges. 
I would give this book an 8 out of 10. I loved reading a story about girl power and bravery.

The U.S. also won the last Women’s World Cup, in 2015. This year’s victory is the fourth for the U.S. in the soccer tournament. That’s more wins than any other team since the Women’s World Cup began, in 1991. 
Megan Rapinoe scored the first of the team’s two points with a tie-breaking penalty kick. Rapinoe is the team captain. She also earned the Golden Boot, which is awarded to the tournament’s top scorer, and the Golden Ball, as top player.
After the final whistle, many fans began chanting “Equal pay!” The U.S. women’s soccer team sued the U.S. Soccer Federation in March. The players are paid less than the men’s national team despite having more victories. The women’s team also gets less award money for winning tournaments. At last year’s World Cup, played by men, the team prize was $400 million. The prize for the 2019 Women’s World Cup was $30 million. 
“I feel like this team is in the midst of changing the world around us as we live, and it’s just an incredible feeling,” Rapinoe said after the match.
Next, the team heads to New York City. They will be celebrated with a ticker-tape parade on Wednesday morning.

823,823,The History of Fireworks,"{'Holidays', 'History'}","
Fireworks may seem like a very American tradition, especially on the 4th of July. But fireworks go back many years before the first American Independence Day celebration, which took place in 1777, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
The earliest fireworks can be traced to around 2,000 years ago in China. People then are said to have roasted bamboo stalks. The stalks turned black and sizzled. The air inside the hollow stalks would explode. Baozhu is a Mandarin Chinese word for firecracker. It means ""exploding bamboo.""
Years later, Chinese chemists took fireworks a step further. This happened sometime between 600 and 900 A.D. People filled bamboo shoots with gunpowder. They threw them into a fire pit. Steel dust or iron shavings were added to make them sparkle. In China, these firecrackers were often used in celebrations.
In the 13th century, fireworks spread to Europe. In the centuries that followed, Europeans began moving to North America. So it was no surprise that when July 4th began to be celebrated as America's Independence Day, fireworks were part of the plan.
John Adams was one of America’s Founding Fathers. He said he hoped the anniversary of the country’s independence would be marked for years to come by ""bonfires"" and ""illuminations.""
The first July 4th celebration happened during the middle of the Revolutionary War. Cannons were fired. Fireworks, too, marked the occasion. 
Today, fireworks are an established July 4 tradition. Will you see a fireworks display this Independence Day? 
Note: It is dangerous (and illegal, in some states) to own and set off fireworks. The use of fireworks is best left to professionals.

824,824,TFK Reads: To Night Owl From Dogfish,"{'Books', 'Time Off'}","
To Night Owl from Dogfish isn’t written by one best-selling author—it’s written by two. Holly Goldberg Sloan and Meg Wolitzer teamed up to tell the story of two girls who go to summer camp together. 
To Night Owl From Dogfish is one of TFK’s 10 recommended reads for summer. After we made our picks, we handed them off to our team of TFK Kid Reporters to get their take. Here, TFK Kid Reporter Ruby West shares her review.
We’ll be posting reviews each week, all summer long. Check back next Tuesday to read about Jasmine Warga’s Other Words for Home.

To Night Owl from Dogfish is a novel written entirely in emails and letters. The book follows two 12-year-old girls: Bett Devlin and Avery Bloom. 
Bett lives in California. She’s an outgoing, thrill-seeking animal lover. Avery lives in New York City. She’s a stressed-out, scared-of-everything writer. The two are very different from each other, but they have one big thing in common. They’re both being raised by single dads. 
Bett and Avery are shocked to find out their dads are dating. And they are less than thrilled to discover that they are being sent to summer camp together for eight weeks. Their dads hope the girls will become friends—and maybe sisters, one day. 
In a crazy turn of events, Bett and Avery are both kicked out of camp. They end up spending the summer together on the adventure of their lives. 
I rate To Night Owl from Dogfish 9 out of 10. It has a relatable plot, a unique format, and very colorful characters.

825,825,Defeating a Legend,"{'Sports', 'World'}","
Fifteen-year-old Cori “Coco” Gauff beat tennis icon Venus Williams yesterday at the Wimbledon tennis tournament, in London, England. 
Cori won 6–4, 6–4 on the first day of the competition. It was the first time she’d played at Wimbledon, the most prestigious tennis tournament in the world. She’s the youngest player to win a women’s singles match at Wimbledon since 1991.  
“My goal was to play my best. My dream was to win. That’s what happened,” Cori said after the match.
Cori lives in Delray Beach, Florida. She has been coached by her father since she was 7. 
Growing up, Cori idolized Venus Williams and her younger sister, Serena Williams. The Williams sisters had both won multiple Wimbledon championships before Cori was even born. 

“The Williams family, in general, made me realize that it was possible,” Cori’s father, Corey Gauff, told the New York Times. “There wasn’t a lot of color in the sport. Particularly in our country, African-American girls weren’t playing tennis.”
Venus Williams is considered one of the world’s greatest tennis players. She’s a five-time Wimbledon champion. She’s 39 years old. But like Cori, she started playing tennis at a young age. She began competing professionally at 14. And she played Wimbledon for the first time at 17. Her match against Cori was the first time Williams has lost in the first round at Wimbledon since 1997. 
Cori moves on to play Magdaléna Rybáriková on July 3.

826,826,A Presidential First in North Korea,"{'Government', 'World'}","
On June 30, President Donald Trump became the first sitting U.S. president to set foot in North Korea. There, he met with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. The historic visit began in the demilitarized zone (DMZ) between North and South Korea. The area is patrolled by armed guards. And while South Korea is a democracy, North Korea is a dictatorship. 
President Trump spent three hours in the DMZ. He and Kim were together for about 80 minutes. They met in the village of Panmunjom. They agreed to restart nuclear talks that ended abruptly in February. The United States wants North Korea to end its nuclear weapons program. 
The visit came together quickly. President Trump had been meeting with world leaders at the G20 Summit, in Japan. While there, he tweeted, referring to Kim: ""I would meet him at the Border/DMZ just to shake his hand and say Hello(?)!"" The tweet was posted about 30 hours before Trump arrived at the DMZ. According to Trump, North Korea was quick to respond. 
At the border, Trump was the first to suggest walking into North Korea. ""Would you like me to step across?"" he asked Kim. An  translated his words. Kim answered through his own interpreter. ""If your excellency would step forward, you will be the first U.S. president to cross the border,"" he said.
U.S. presidents and officials have traveled to the DMZ before. However, it was usually to show the U.S.commitment to defending South Korea. The country is a U.S. ally. During the Korean War, between North and South Korea, the U.S. sent troops to help South Korea. The war ended with a  in 1953. 
After Trump’s Sunday meeting with Kim, he told reporters that he had invited the North Korean dictator to Washington, D.C.

Stacy and Gina don’t get along. They’re rivals on the baseball field. Gina is the star player on an all-star team. Stacy is on the underdog team, which hasn’t won a game all season. 
The girls also can’t stand each other at home. Stacy and Gina are twin sisters. They also happen to be the youngest in a long line of witches.
In the new graphic novel Dugout: The Zombie Steals Home, Gina and Stacy’s magic gets out of hand. They accidentally unleash zombies and other scary creatures. Now the sisters must work together to save the day. 
Scott Morse is the author and illustrator of Dugout. He told TIME for Kids the book is about communication. “I find that kids and adults alike often wear a mask and hide what they’re really feeling under a false front,” he says. “It can really cause problems when people don’t stop to talk.” 
Morse has worked on popular movies like Brave and Cars. He says the storytelling skills he learned working on movies were put to use in Dugout. He used them to create a story that seems scary at first but which, on closer inspection, can be understood differently. “Scary things are only scary if you let them be scary,” Morse says.

828,828,Florida's Fire,"{'United States', 'Weather'}","
A wildfire broke out in the Florida Everglades on Sunday night. By Monday it had doubled in size. Soon it had consumed some 42,000 acres. As of Wednesday evening, the so-called Sawgrass Fire was 75% contained. 
The Florida Everglades is a natural region of tropical wetlands. It covers more than 4,000 square miles in the south of Florida.  
The Sawgrass Fire was sparked by lightning, according to the Florida Forest Service. Lightning strikes “can be five times hotter than the sun,” says Paul Walker. He’s a senior meteorologist at AccuWeather. Lightning’s energy evaporates moisture, Walker says. This causes anything lightning strikes to combust. And South Florida has experienced unusually hot and dry weather this week. That lack of rain helped the fire spread rapidly.  
No buildings have been damaged by the fire. The smoke caused hazy conditions along a busy stretch of Interstate 75 known as Alligator Alley. Winds also pushed smoke toward Broward County, leading to poor air quality in the area. Fire officials sent out a Twitter message on Monday: “Residents with breathing complications should take appropriate measures.” Keeping doors and windows closed can also keep smoke at bay.

829,829,Democrats Debate,"{'Government', 'Election 2020'}","
The race to become the next president of the United States is on. A record-setting 24 Democrats are campaigning for the 2020 election. Twenty of them will face off in debates to be held tonight and tomorrow in Miami, Florida. The debates will give candidates a chance to get their message out to voters and stand out from the rest of the pack. (See below for the full list of candidates.)
They won’t have much time. Each candidate will have only 60 seconds to respond to moderators’ questions. They’ll get another 30 seconds to respond to their opponents. The candidates will have to be brief. Key issues will include health care, climate change, and making college tuition-free.
Each candidate is looking for a moment to shine. A zinger aimed at an opponent. A clever one-liner. These are the quickest ways to communicate to millions of TV viewers. These short messages can spread on social media. 
Some of the candidates are already well-known. On Wednesday, look for Elizabeth Warren to be the center of attention. She’s a senator from Massachusetts. Warren has been crisscrossing the country for months, telling people about her ideas. Former vice president Joe Biden and Vermont senator Bernie Sanders will be part of Thursday’s group. Right now, they are leading in the polls. Their popularity with voters will make them targets for the other debaters.
Only one of the 24 candidates will go on to become the Democratic nominee for president. He or she will face President Donald Trump, who is up for re-election. Will the president be watching the debates? Trump told Fox Business Network that he would.
Tonight’s debate will air on NBC, MSNBC, and Telemundo from 9 p.m. to 11 p.m. ET.


Wednesday’s debate will include:
Cory Booker, senator from New JerseyJulián Castro, former secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban DevelopmentBill de Blasio, mayor of New York CityJohn Delaney, former representative from MarylandTulsi Gabbard, representative from HawaiiJay Inslee, governor of WashingtonAmy Klobuchar, senator from MinnesotaBeto O’Rourke, former representative from TexasTim Ryan, representative from OhioElizabeth Warren, senator from Massachusetts

830,830,Meet the STEM Queen,"{'People', 'Science'}","
Jacqueline Means, 16, is known as the STEM Queen. She is the founder of the Wilmington Urban STEM Initiative, in Wilmington, Delaware. The organization promotes STEM to underprivileged girls in Wilmington. Means spoke with TFK Kid Reporter Tiana Sirmans, also of Delaware.
You’re known as the STEM Queen. How did you get that title? 
I am the self-proclaimed STEM Queen. I’ve always loved science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. I think it’s so fascinating that STEM can be involved in every aspect of our lives. Our phones: technology. Our cars: engineering. I call myself the STEM Queen because I think it’s queenly to do good for others. 
Can you tell me about your organization, the Wilmington Urban STEM Initiative? 
The Wilmington Urban STEM Initiative is an organization I founded almost four years ago because I wanted to get girls involved with STEM. Too often, girls aren’t shown STEM in a fun way. I bring exciting experiments to my events. The girls get to be hands-on with them, because I think learning comes from doing it yourself. All my events are totally free. I invite between 50 and 75 girls to come to a full day of fun STEM education. 
What’s your favorite thing about teaching STEM? 
I like seeing the girls’ mind-sets change. At my second or third event, I saw some of the girls walking in. I could see on their faces that they were like, “STEM? I don't even know what that is.” And when I told them what it was, they were like, “Well, we don't like any of that.” Then I remember going through the experiments, and the girls had these big smiles on their faces. Their eyes were sparkly and their faces were just lit up. At the end of the event, they came up to me and said, “Thanks for doing this. This was actually really fun.” 

With a background in STEM, what are some jobs kids can get into? 
There are many jobs outside of traditional science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. For example, there are people who work at cosmetics companies who make lipsticks and powders and all kinds of makeup products. That’s science. If you are passionate about making people look good and feel good with makeup, that’s part of the STEM field too. 
When you’re not in school or teaching STEM, what do you like to do for fun? 
I like to play video games. I’m also learning how to code. I have a little app that I'm learning a lot from. It’s teaching me how to code and read JavaScript. It’s really cool. 
What’s your goal for the Wilmington Urban STEM Initiative? 
I want my impact to be more than just in Wilmington. My goal is for it to be the entire world. I think once I try to have an impact in as many ways as I can in Delaware, I want to branch out and have a positive impact and influence on as many young girls as possible.

Team U.S.A. is heading to the quarterfinals in the Women’s World Cup. 
The U.S. beat Spain 2–1 on Tuesday in one of the soccer tournament’s knockout rounds. (In a knockout-round game, the losing team is removed from the tournament.) It was a hard-fought match. Megan Rapinoe scored the first U.S. goal less than seven minutes into the game. Spain tied the score two minutes later. Neither team scored again until 75 minutes into the match. That’s when Rapinoe scored on a penalty kick. 
“I think we showed just a lot of grit and experience, to be honest, in this game,” Rapinoe says. 
The U.S. will face France in the quarterfinals. They’re being held in Paris, France, on Friday. The winner of that game will advance to the semifinals on July 2. 
Friday’s match is eagerly anticipated by soccer fans around the world. France and the U.S. are two of the leading teams in women’s soccer. The U.S. team is the defending Women’s World Cup champion. It won the most recent tournament in 2015. France hopes to be the first nation to hold both the men’s and women’s World Cup titles at the same time. The French men’s team won the World Cup last year in Russia. 
“I think it's going to be a great match,” Rapinoe says. “I hope it's wild and crazy. I hope the fans are crazy and there's tons of media around it and it's just a big spectacle. I think this is incredible for the women's game.”

832,832,TFK Reads: Pie in the Sky,"{'Books', 'Time Off'}","
Pie in the Sky is part novel, part comic book, with a dash of cookbook thrown in. It’s the story of two brothers who move to a new place where they feel like they don’t belong. Together, they find refuge in the kitchen, baking cakes. 
Pie in the Sky is one of TFK’s 10 recommended reads for summer. After we made our picks, we handed them off to our team of TFK Kid Reporters to get their take. Here, TFK Kid Reporter Will Holland shares his review. 
We’ll be posting reviews each week, all summer long. Check back next Wednesday to read about To Night Owl from Dogfish. 

In Pie in the Sky, 11-year-old Jingwen’s father has died. Jingwen, his mother, and his little brother, Yanghao, move to Australia. Jingwen doesn’t speak English, and the whole family is still mourning. As the book goes on, Jingwen and Yanghao bond as they bake their father’s favorite cake recipes. 
The author emphasizes that Jingwen and Yanghao don’t get along. This is very realistic because the majority of siblings fight! I have found myself in situations similar to Jingwen’s. 
As the story continues, several different plots develop at the same time. Heavy topics are covered throughout the book. Author Remy Lai does a wonderful job expressing the challenges Jingwen faces and how hard it is to accept change. 
The book also contains many adorable illustrations and cartoons. This makes flipping the pages fun and the book easier for slow readers like myself. 
And who doesn’t love cake? This book includes an actual cake recipe. I tested it out, and it was delicious!

A giant telescope will be built on Mauna Kea, a  Hawaiian volcano that some people consider . 
Hawaii governor David Ige announced on June 20 that construction of the telescope had been approved. It’s called the Thirty Meter Telescope, or TMT. It will be the largest telescope in the northern hemisphere. Construction is expected to begin this summer.
The TMT will allow scientists to see faraway parts of the universe. Their observations could help researchers understand how the universe was formed. 
But the telescope is . Mauna Kea is the highest point in Hawaii. The volcano holds religious importance for many Native Hawaiians. Activists say construction will dishonor sacred grounds. 
Kealoha Pisciotta is a Native Hawaiian activist. “These are places of worship and the places where we lay our offering and our prayer,” she told the AP. 
Astronomers say Mauna Kea is one of the best places on Earth to build a telescope. There are several smaller telescopes there already. As part of the plan to build the TMT, five of them will be torn down. 
Plans for the TMT were first proposed in 2009. The project has been locked in a legal battle ever since. Last year, the Hawaii Supreme Court ruled that plans for the telescope could continue. 
“This decision of the Hawaiian Supreme Court is the law of the land, and it should be respected,” Governor Ige said. “We will proceed in a way that respects the people, place, and culture that make Hawaii unique.”

Selah Schneiter, 10, has become one of the youngest people to climb El Capitan, a rock formation in Yosemite National Park, in California. Selah scaled the 3,000-foot peak with her father, Mike Schneiter, and family friend Mark Reiger. The team completed the five-day climb on June 12. 
Getting to the top of El Capitan is no easy feat. It is taller than the tallest building in the world, Dubai’s Burj Khalifa, in the United Arab Emirates. Some have died trying to climb the granite rock face. But many more have completed the journey, including Selah's parents. They met on a climbing trip up the mountain 15 years ago.
On Wednesday, Selah told morning TV show Today that reaching the top was “really overwhelming.” But the hardest part was getting down. “You’re carrying everything, and you’re really tired,” she said. 
It’s unclear if Selah is the youngest climber to make the trip. A Yosemite spokesperson told USA Today the park does not keep those kinds of records. 
Everyone in Selah's family loves to climb. The family has a climbing wall in the garage. ""I'm super proud of her, just to see how big her heart was and how strong she was,"" her dad told Today. ""She just did great preparing for it, training for it.""

836,836,Skyscraper Games,"{'People', 'Technology'}","
On June 10, at 8 p.m., more than a hundred people were gathered in a tent in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. They were there to play video games. But they wouldn’t be playing on any ordinary gaming system. Instead, they were gearing up to play games that would be displayed on a glass skyscraper called the Cira Centre. “There was a really great energy in the tent that night,” Ainsley Soulchin, 13, told TIME for Kids. 
Ainsley’s a seventh grader at the Upper Merion Area Middle School, near Philadelphia. She participated in Skyscraper Video Games for Kids. It’s a program that teaches middle school students how to code video games. 
In the program, Ainsley coded a game. She calls the game Dot Man. In Dot Man, a player has to pass through a maze without getting caught by a dot. On June 10, the public got to play Dot Man and other other student-made video games on the outside of the Cira Centre. Ainsley was proud of her accomplishment. “When you see your game on the building,” she said, “you’re like ‘Wow. I made this.’”
Game Changer
Frank Lee founded Skyscraper Video Games for Kids. He’s a professor of digital media at Drexel University, in Philadelphia. He wanted to initiate others in the joy of playing video games. So he found a way to make that happen. 
“Years ago, I was driving past the Cira Centre,” Lee told TFK. “I thought, ‘Wouldn’t it be cool to make a game out of that building?'” He noticed there were LED lights embedded between the skyscraper’s floors. Lee knew if he could access the building’s computer system, he could manipulate the LED lights. This would allow him to display video games on the skyscraper. People could play these games using a joystick. The joystick would be connected to a computer outside the building. And the computer would send wireless commands to the skyscraper's internal system. 
On April 19, 2013, Lee arranged for Pong, a video game inspired by table tennis, to be played on the Cira Centre. It scored a Guinness World Record for World’s Largest Architectural Video Game Display. In 2014, Lee arranged for Tetris to be played on the same building. It broke the 2013 record. At 119,600 square feet, the Tetris display was twice the size that Pong had been. 
Now Lee shares his passion for game design with kids. With funding from Intel, he trains educators to create video games. The educators then teach their students those same skills. 

Christian Johnson is one such educator. He teaches at Ainsley’s middle school. ""Having the students’ video games be shown on such a large, public display can give them motivation to keep creating,"" Johnson told TFK. 
Ainsley plans to continue coding. “I’ve always loved to build stuff,” she says. “Coding is just another opportunity to build something and make it my own. And I really like that.”

By the end of 2018, nearly 71 million people around the world had been displaced by war, , and other violence. That’s according to the United Nations Refugee Agency’s annual “Global Trends” report. It was released today. 
That number includes nearly 26 million refugees. The U.N. defines refugees as people who have fled their home countries for safety. The number also includes 3.5 million asylum seekers. Asylum seekers have also fled their home countries but have not yet been given refugee status. And more than 41 million are known as Internally Displaced People (IDPs). IDPs are displaced within their own country. 
Filippo Grandi is the U.N. high commissioner for refugees. He spoke to reporters in Geneva, Switzerland. That's where the second-largest U.N. office in the world is located. Grandi said there has been an increase of 2 million refugees since the end of 2017. He then explained why. “There are new conflicts, new situations, producing refugees, adding themselves to the old ones,” Grandi told reporters. “The old [situations] never get resolved.” 
According to the report, the largest population of refugees is from Syria. After eight years of war in the country, about 13 million people have been displaced. Many people from countries such as Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador are also fleeing violence. 
The report arrives a day before World Refugee Day, which is June 20. This day is meant to raise awareness and show support for refugees. According to Grandi, countries must work together to find solutions. “This is complex work,” Grandi said in a press release. “(It) requires all countries to come together for a common good.”

Rodkey writes in an entertaining way and makes us think about what it would be like to face massive annihilation. The book made me realize that emotions are valuable. It also made me think about whether there could be intelligent species living on other planets. It would be very cool to find creatures like the ones on Planet Choom.

There have been massive protests on the streets of Hong Kong this month. It’s estimated that about 2 million people have taken part. That’s more than a quarter of the country’s population. 
Protests began on June 9. Organizers say about a million people showed up that day. People are protesting a . They don’t want the government to make it a law. If it does become a law, people in Hong Kong who have been accused of crimes could be sent to other countries to stand trial. This process is called extradition. Protesters are worried that mainland China would use this law to imprison people from Hong Kong who act or speak out against the Chinese government. Doing so is legal in Hong Kong. In mainland China, it’s not.
On the night of June 9, Hong Kong’s government issued a statement. It said the plan to move forward with the bill would continue despite the protests. This angered many people. There were confrontations between protesters and police. Some turned violent. Protests continued throughout the week. More and more people joined in. 
Many of the protesters are students. One of them is 14-year-old Anna So. “I think it’s important that I am here to support the demonstrations,” she told TIME at a gathering on June 13. “I want to protect Hong Kong. I don’t want Hong Kong to lose its freedoms.”

Carrie Lam is Hong Kong’s top government official. She has led the charge to pass the bill. On Saturday, she announced that the bill would be suspended. On Sunday, and again on Tuesday, she apologized to the people of Hong Kong. But the protests continue. Why? Protesters don’t feel that suspending the bill for a time is enough. They want it permanently withdrawn. They also want Lam to .
Joshua Wong is a well-known political activist in Hong Kong. “It is going to be a long battle for us to fight for our democracy under the  Party of China,” he said. “I’m not sure how many months this battle will take.”
Hong Kong was a colony of the United Kingdom until 1997, when it was returned to China. Since then, Hong Kong and China have existed according to a “one country, two systems” agreement. This agreement allows Hong Kong to be part of China while having its own government and courts, as well as control of its own economy. People in Hong Kong want to make sure this agreement stays in place.
Shanice Yu is a 14-year-old protester. “I feel I have the responsibility to fight for our city’s freedoms,” she told TIME on Monday.

On Saturday, the first mass was held at Notre-Dame cathedral since the church was ravaged by fire in April. 
The service took place in a small side chapel. For security reasons, only about 30 people were allowed to attend. They were mainly priests, church employees, and workers who are rebuilding the church. The mass was broadcast on YouTube. 
The heavily damaged building is still in fragile condition. But experts said it was safe to hold the service. Priests and worshippers wore hard hats. Charred wooden beams and holes in the vaulted ceiling were visible. 
Father Pierre Vivares spoke to the Associated Press outside the cathedral on Saturday. “Today, it’s a small but a true victory against the disaster we have had,” he said. 
The mass came exactly two months after the devastating blaze on April 15. The building’s iconic spire and much of its wooden roof were destroyed. But the cathedral remained standing. 
Donors around the world have pledged nearly $1 billion to restore Notre-Dame. This has been met with some criticism. Critics say money should instead have been given to organizations that help needy people in France. 
Still, French president Emmanuel Macron has said that the rebuilding of Notre-Dame “must be done” in five years. French lawmakers are considering a law designed to quicken the pace of the work. It would allow the project to sidestep some labor laws.  
“We will rebuild this cathedral,” Vivares says. “It will take time, of course—a lot of money, lot of time, lot of work—but we will succeed.”

When the actors return, they must improvise their reactions to the audience’s choices. That means the actors are making up their lines as they go along. 

The show stars Ramon Reed, 13, and Kaylin Hayman, 11. They talked to TFK Kid Reporter Alana Cho about improvising. “One thing that I’ve learned is to build one brick at a time,” Ramon says. “You don’t need to build a whole house. You can constantly add more layers to the story that you are trying to tell while improvising.” Kaylin says it’s important to “go with your gut and trust your cast members.” 
Just Roll with It officially premieres June 19 on Disney Channel and DisneyNOW.

The American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) is one of the most popular museums in the United States. Located in New York City, it was founded in 1869. Visitors from around the world go to see its vast collection of dinosaur fossils and explore the solar system in its planetarium. This year, the museum marked its 150th anniversary. Now, construction has begun on its new education center. On Wednesday morning, elected officials, museum leaders, and children gathered for a groundbreaking ceremony. 
“Education is at the core” of the museum, Lewis Bernard announced. He is chairman of the American Museum of Natural History. Museum president Ellen Futter also spoke. She said the new addition “will be a spectacular and vitally important resource for science and education.”   
The building will be known as the Richard Gilder Center for Science, Education, and Innovation. Design and construction are expected to cost $383 million. The center is scheduled to open in 2022.

The Gilder Center will be home to several innovative exhibits. One will be called the Collections Core. It will display 4 million scientific specimens and artifacts. The Insectarium will be dedicated to insects. The Butterfly Vivarium will house living butterflies. The Gilder Center will feature classrooms, a library, and an immersive theater to help visitors imagine scientific ideas. 
Bill de Blasio is the mayor of New York City. He was among the speakers at Wednesday’s ceremony. De Blasio said the Gilder Center will allow AMNH to better serve young visitors. He called the museum “a place of joy and exploration for children around the world.”

844,844,Canada Will Ban Single-Use Plastic,"{'Environment', 'World'}","
Canada has set a goal to ban single-use plastics by as early as 2021. The country wants to reduce waste that ends up in the ecosystem. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced the plan on Monday. 
Single-use plastics include bags, straws, and cutlery. They will not be allowed in Canada, Trudeau said in a statement. Companies that make or sell plastic products will be required to dispose of waste responsibly.
Every year, Canada throws away more than 3 million tons of plastic. It recycles only 10% of that. The Canadian government says that more than a million birds worldwide are killed or injured by plastic waste each year. So are 100,000 sea mammals. 
“When we take our kids to the beach . . . we have to search out a patch of sand that isn’t littered with straws, Styrofoam, or bottles,” Trudeau said, according to the BBC. “That’s a problem we have to do something about.”
Canada isn’t the first country that plans to ban single-use plastic. The European Union has voted to ban plastic straws and food containers by 2021. India has pledged to eliminate all of its single-use plastic by 2022.
Trudeau’s announcement follows another recent event. Malaysia and the Philippines said they would send tons of non-recyclable waste back to its country of origin. That includes Canada. Southeast Asian nations say they are a dumping ground for wealthier countries. China barred the import of scrap plastic last year.
Canada has pledged to take back its rubbish. “We owe it to our kids to keep the environment clean and safe for generations to come,” Trudeau said.

845,845,Alex Morgan Strikes Back,"{'United States', 'Sports'}","
When Alex Morgan was 8, she left a note for her mom at their home in Diamond Bar, California. “Hi Mommy!” Morgan wrote. “My name is Alex and I am going to be a professional athlete for soccer!” She signed it “Ali Cat.”
Morgan has made good on that promise. She is now the United States women’s soccer player of the year. She is the sport’s most popular American star. In April, she became one of the youngest female soccer players to score 100 international goals. And on Tuesday, she scored five goals for Team U.S.A. in its first 2019 World Cup game—a 13-0 victory over Thailand.
As the defending champion and top-ranked team, the U.S. is favored to win. But this year’s competition is tough. When the U.S. hosted the World Cup in 1999, only a few countries were considered contenders. Now, many more have a real shot.
Morgan, 29, is the face of Team U.S.A. She appears on billboards and in TV commercials. She has millions of followers on social media. She has starred in a movie, written a book series, and appeared onstage with Taylor Swift.
But Morgan has never dominated the World Cup. She lost along with Team U.S.A. in 2011, and in 2015, she was held back by injuries. This year is a chance for her to make her mark.

Coming Up
As a kid, Morgan didn’t just play competitive soccer. Instead, she played many different sports. She only began playing elite travel soccer at 14, years later than many others who become professional athletes. She credits playing a range of sports with preventing burnout. “When I went to soccer practice, I was really excited,” Morgan says. “Because I hadn’t been there in four days.”
Morgan’s speed and knack for scoring earned her a soccer scholarship to the University of California, Berkeley. After graduating, she helped lead the U.S. to the 2008 FIFA U-20 Women’s World Cup title with a brilliant left-footed goal in the final. Then she was called up to the senior squad—Team U.S.A.
Her impact was immediate. Morgan scored a key goal against Italy to help the U.S. qualify for the 2011 World Cup. She became a go-to substitute in that tournament, scoring in both the semifinals and the final game. (The U.S. lost the cup to Japan in the final.)
Morgan’s performance on the 2012 Olympic team made her a star. She appeared in McDonald’s ads with LeBron James, published an autobiography, and became the highest-paid female soccer player in the U.S. 

Abby Wambach is one of Morgan’s former teammates. “What’s unique about Alex is the closer she gets to the goal, the slower the game happens for her,” Wambach says. “It's like something else inside of her body just goes into a natural state of flow that allows her to score goals. Her power is unlike anything I’ve ever seen.”
But injuries became a problem for Morgan. She had issues with her knee at the 2015 Women’s World Cup. Though her team won, Morgan isn’t proud of her performance. “I don’t feel like I met my goals,” she says.
A year later, at the 2016 Olympics, Sweden defeated the U.S. in the quarterfinals. It was the earliest the U.S. women’s team had been eliminated from a major international tournament. That was a low moment for Morgan. She needed to rediscover her passion for the game. So she moved to France and joined a French club team. She says the move was “something I needed at the time . . . to focus on soccer solely and entirely.”
With Morgan, her French team soared, winning the league championship, the French Cup, and the Women’s Champions League title. More important, Morgan rediscovered the joy of playing. 
Taking a Stand
In 2016, five of Team U.S.A.’s star players filed a complaint over pay inequity. In April 2017, the players signed a new agreement with the United States Soccer Federation. The agreement meant a slight improvement but did not, in the opinion of the players, make things right. So in March, the players filed a lawsuit against their employers. They want to close the pay gap once and for all. 
Morgan is listed first in the lawsuit. “Eventually, you just have to take a stand,” she says.

The lawsuit could take months to play out. But whatever the result, Team U.S.A. has already won. That’s because their push for equal pay has inspired other female athletes to fight for their fair share. 
To Morgan, the best way to state her case is on the field. She sees another World Cup win as essential to boosting public support for equal pay. To prepare, Morgan has studied video of her performances and worked on a bending left-footed shot from outside the 18-yard box. “If we do our job,” she says, “people will be captivated. This can be something greater and bigger than there’s ever been before.”

Actress Ali Stroker made history at the 2019 Tony Awards on Sunday. She became the first actor in a wheelchair to win the award. Stroker won Best Featured Actress in a Musical for her role in Oklahoma!
The Tony Awards celebrate accomplishments in live theater on Broadway. Stroker gave an acceptance speech. She spoke to young people who have dreams of performing. “This award is for every kid who is watching tonight who has a disability, who has a limitation or a challenge, who has been waiting to see themselves represented in this arena,” she said. “You are.” 
Stroker was paralyzed in a car accident when she was a toddler. She began performing when she was 7 years old. Stroker became the first wheelchair user to perform on Broadway. That was in 2015. She appeared in the musical Spring Awakening. 
Some theaters are not accessible for Stroker. The Tonys took place at Radio City Music Hall. The theater did not have a ramp at the front of the stage. Stroker waited backstage. She entered from the wings to accept her award.
Many theaters have ramps and reserved seating for wheelchair users in the audience. But these features are often not available backstage for cast members. Stroker says the Oklahoma! team has been “so supportive” of her needs. “Circle in the Square [theater] put in a stair lift for me to get down to the dressing rooms and stage level,” Stroker told the Los Angeles Times earlier this month. “They also put in a ramp backstage so I can get around.” She added, “This was a big deal.” 
After winning her award, Stroker spoke with reporters about the need for change. “I would ask theater owners and producers to really look into how they can begin to make the backstage accessible so that performers with disabilities can get around,” she said.

Want to visit the International Space Station? You may soon get your chance. There’s just one hitch: It’ll cost you $58 million.
Last Friday, NASA announced it will open the space station to tourists. The first mission could happen as early as 2020. Those who are lucky—and rich—enough to make the trip will spend up to 30 days in orbit. The cost is about $35,000 per night. In addition, the space agency will charge visitors for food, storage, and communication.
""But it won't come with any Hilton or Marriott points,"" Jeff DeWit joked at a news conference. DeWit is NASA’s chief financial officer. Hilton and Marriott are hotel chains that offer rewards, in the form of points, to customers. Points can be redeemed for free stays. 
Visitors will not make the trip in NASA spacecraft. Instead, the agency has made arrangements for private aerospace companies SpaceX and Boeing to carry passengers. These companies will also provide medical testing and training for customers.
The program is part of NASA’s plan to open the space station to private enterprise. Eventually, the station will become too costly for the U.S. government to keep up, says NASA’s Bill Gerstenmaier. The goal is to let private companies use the station now and someday run it on their own. This will allow NASA to focus time and money on sending astronauts to the moon in 2024.

Charnaie Gordon reads a lot of books. She writes about  children’s books on her website, Here Wee Read. Publishers send her books to review. She reads many of them with her 6-year-old daughter, Madison, and her 5-year-old son, Barrington.
The family can’t keep all the books. For a while, they donated the extras to their library. Then Madison had an idea: The family could give the books to kids who need them. 
In August 2018, the family started 50 States, 50 Books. It’s an initiative to donate 50 diverse children’s books to every state in the country. 
Diversity Matters

Gordon says it’s important to read about characters of different races, from a variety of backgrounds and cultures. “It helps kids understand they can do and be whatever they want,” she told TIME for Kids. “It allows kids to see into the world of others.” 
Growing up, Gordon didn’t read many books with characters who looked like her. “Corduroy, by Don Freeman, was it for me,” she says. It features an African-American character. To her own kids, Gordon reads books about people who look like them and about people who are unfamiliar. “It’s powerful for kids to be able to relate to kids in a whole different country,” she says. “They can see the similarities and differences, and have more empathy toward one another.” 
Spreading the Word
When she launched 50 States, 50 Books, Gordon didn’t know what to expect. But a week after she announced the project on her blog, book donations began arriving in the mail. 
By November, her family had collected more than 700 books. A publisher, Hachette, sent 800 more. With that donation, they could send 50 books to 30 states. 
In May, a final donation, from author Minh Lê and his wife, Aimee, got the family to its goal of 2,500 books. 

Madison and Barrington helped their mom sort through the donations. The family mailed the books to schools, libraries, and organizations that needed them. 
“It’s been a journey, to go from not knowing if anyone would be interested to finishing in nine months,” Gordon says. “It blows my mind.”
Now that Gordon has finished her 50 States, 50 Books challenge, she’s beginning another one. This summer, she’s working with Pizza Hut’s Book It! program to encourage children to donate 50 books to any organization or individual. The first 100 participants to submit a picture of their donation will receive a family pizza party. 
“We had so many kids and families say they were inspired by our project,” Gordon said. “So I wanted to see if kids would be inspired to get involved.” The challenge ends August 9.

Tom Rice is a 97-year-old veteran from San Diego, California. On Wednesday, and for the second time in his life, he parachuted into Normandy, France. The first time was on June 6, 1944. That day is known as D-Day. 
During World War II, the Allied forces (including Great Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and China) fought to free Europe from the Nazis. On D-Day, they made the largest military invasion in history. It is thought of as one of the most important moments in the war. Rice and others risked their lives by parachuting into Normandy in advance of the sea invasion.
Rice and about 200 other parachutists jumped on Wednesday to commemorate the 75th anniversary of D-Day. Rice and another parachutist jumped from a C-47 transport aircraft. They landed near where Rice landed in 1944, outside the Normandy town of Carentan, the site of a key World War II battle. 
“It went perfect: perfect jump,” Rice said, according to the Associated Press.
World leaders are marking D-Day in several ways this week. Yesterday, President Donald Trump joined Queen Elizabeth II in Portsmouth, England, to honor those who fought.
Meanwhile, Rice proved he was as brave Wednesday as he was 75 years ago.
“I feel great,” he said after the jump. “I’d go up and do it all again.”

The Women’s World Cup kicks off in France this weekend. Twenty-four teams from around the world will take part in the soccer tournament. The United States is the defending champion, having defeated Japan in the most recent World Cup finals, in 2015. The competition begins on Friday, when host team France takes on South Korea. 
Experts say the competition will be especially fierce this year. “This is the first time I have ever been able to name potential winners on more than one hand,” says Julie Foudy. She played for the U.S. team when it won the cup in 1999. Now she’s an analyst for the sports network ESPN. “Absolutely, this is the most competitive World Cup I have seen.”
For the first round of the tournament, the 24 teams involved have been split into six groups of four. The U.S. team is part of a group with Thailand, Chile, and Sweden. Each team will play the other teams in its group three times. The results of those games will determine which 16 teams advance to the next round. 
After multiple rounds of knockout play, two teams will face off in a final game on July 7. The winner of that game will be declared the tournament’s champion.
The Women’s World Cup began in 1991. The U.S. has won three times: in 1991, 1999, and 2015. As the team works to add a fourth title to that list, it does so under added pressure. On March 8, all 28 of its members filed a lawsuit against the United States Soccer Federation (USSF). The lawsuit says the USSF discriminates against female athletes. It pays them much less than male athletes. 
Alex Morgan is one of the team’s captains. She is expected to play a big part in its World Cup performance. Morgan made a statement about the lawsuit in March. “As players, we deserve to be paid equally for our work,” she said. “Regardless of our gender.”

852,852,The Price of Pollution,"{'Business', 'Environment'}","
A federal court in Miami, Florida, has ordered Carnival Corporation to pay a $20 million penalty. Years ago, the cruise ship company was ordered to stop polluting the ocean. The court says the company has continued to do so. 
In 2016, a court found Carnival Corp. guilty of covering up the fact that it was discharging oily waste from its ships. At that time, the penalty was $40 million. On Monday, Carnival CEO Arnold Donald admitted the cruise line had broken the law again. “The company pleads guilty,” he said to a packed courtroom. “We acknowledge the shortcomings. I am here today to formulate a plan to fix them.” 
“The proof will be in the pudding, won’t it?” judge Patricia Seitz replied. “If you all did not have the environment, you would have nothing to sell.”
Carnival is the world’s largest cruise line. It owns nine cruise brands and 105 ships worldwide. Its ships carry passengers to some of the most beautiful locations in the world. But in court, the company admitted to several crimes. These include dumping “gray water” in places like Alaska's Glacier Bay National Park. Gray water includes wastewater from sinks and washing machines. The company has also been dumping food waste and plastic in the Bahamas. This poses a threat to marine life. 
The court has given Carnival a fall deadline to make changes. The company will have to improve the way it trains employees. It will also have to change how it reports environmental violations. From time to time, officials will check to make sure the company adheres to the court’s ruling. Another proposed change is a reduction in single-use plastic items. These include plastic straws and cups. The company may also work to improve how waste is handled at sea.
At an earlier hearing, Judge Seitz threatened to prohibit Carnival from docking at U.S. ports. She even warned that future violations could lead to prison time for company leaders. “My goal is to have the defendant change its behavior,” Seitz said.

The finals were scheduled to end at 10 p.m. But the spellers were too good.
At around 11:30 p.m., eight contestants were still going strong. They had spelled perfectly for seventeen straight rounds. The competition’s official pronouncer, Jacques Bailly, made a historic announcement. “We do have plenty of words remaining in our list,” he told the contestants. “But we’ll soon run out of words that will challenge you.” Bailly then said that any contestant who spelled correctly through the next three rounds would be crowned a champion. 
All of the remaining contestants rose to the challenge. 
“I don't know if I would’ve won if they kept going,” said 13-year-old Saketh Sundar. He’s one of the champs. “I was super tired.”
The rules on the bee’s website allow for three champions. Paige Kimble is the bee’s executive director. She confirmed that her team decided to amend the rules. They did this once they realized how strong the competitors were. “They worked so hard and they achieved so much,” Kimble said. “I think it’s the best night ever for the bee.”

An electric flying vehicle called Skai (pronounced “sky”) was  yesterday near Los Angeles, California. Skai is made by Alaka’i Technologies. The vehicle has six rotors on top. Inside, there are seats for five passengers. To many people, Skai looks like a cross between a giant drone and a car. Alaka’i Technologies hopes the vehicle will one day serve as a flying taxi, a cargo carrier, and an ambulance. 
Other companies, such as Boeing and Airbus, are also designing electric aircraft. They are using batteries to power them. But batteries can weigh the vehicles down.
Skai uses hydrogen fuel cells to power its rotors. Hydrogen fuel cells are a lighter alternative to batteries. They allow the vehicle to transport 1,000 pounds. They might also be less damaging to the environment. “It’s the cleanest form of energy on the planet,” Bruce Holmes told Digital Trends, a technology news website. Holmes is on the board of Alaka’i Technologies. 
A test flight will take place near the company’s Massachusetts headquarters. But it may be years before the aircraft is cleared to carry passengers. Skai must first meet regulations. These regulations are set by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). 
“The technology is interesting, but the regulatory road will be very long,” Thaddeus Lightfoot said. Lightfoot is an attorney. He helps companies navigate FAA rules.
Alaka’i Technologies is hopeful that Skai will get FAA approval to fly passengers soon. In the meantime, the company’s CEO, Stephen Hanvey, says the craft could be used to transport food and water. It could also serve as a mobile cell tower in places struck by natural disasters.

On Wednesday, special counsel Robert Mueller formally ended his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. He also made clear that he would prefer not to  before Congress.
“The report is my testimony,” he told a group of reporters at the Justice Department, in Washington, D.C. After the Mueller report was released by his department on April 18, some lawmakers called on Mueller to speak about it before Congress. Today’s remarks were the first public comments Mueller has made since the investigation began.
During his nine-minute statement, Mueller repeated the conclusions of his team’s 448-page report. He said that Russians hackers interfered in the 2016 election, but that investigators did not find enough evidence to conclude that any Americans plotted with the Russians to do so. 
“I have not spoken publicly during our investigation,” he said. “I am speaking out today because our investigation is complete. The attorney general [Wiliam Barr] has made the report on our investigation largely public.” He added that the special counsel’s office will be formally closed and that he will be  from the Department of Justice. Mueller was chosen to lead the Russia investigation two years ago, in May 2017. 
The Mueller report does not say whether or not President Donald Trump  justice during the investigation. “We did not . . . make a determination as to whether the president did commit a crime,” he said today. Mueller said that Congress could make that decision on its own.
Mueller ended his address by repeating that the investigation found multiple efforts to interfere in the presidential election of 2016. “That allegation deserves the attention of every American,” he said.

Scientists at the Wolong National Nature Reserve, in China, have made an unusual discovery. With a motion-activated camera, they caught an image of an all-white bear trudging through the forest. The creature may look like a polar bear, but it’s not. Scientists believe they have the world’s first image of a rare albino panda. The photograph was taken in April and released this past weekend.
Albinism is a rare genetic condition. It causes a lack of melanin in the body. Melanin determines the color of skin, hair, and eyes. The albino panda has white fur, white claws, and red eyes. It does not have the black patches usually seen on pandas. The condition has not harmed the panda’s health. Li Sheng is a researcher for the Species Survival Commission of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). “Based on the photo, albinism has not affected the life of the white panda much,” he told the New York Times. “It looks quite well, quite strong.”
But the panda could face some problems. Its all-white color makes it more visible to predators. It may also have impaired vision and a hard time finding food. And because it is rare, the bear could be valuable to . In 2017, a conservation group had to rescue a rare albino orangutan from a village in Indonesia. It now lives in a protected forest. But some worry it is still a target.
Giant pandas are currently listed as vulnerable. According to the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, about 2,000 of them remain in the wild.

Her mom, Jamie Graham, says she tried to get Neijae’s older brother to take the barbering course. When he didn’t want to go, Neijae decided to give it a try.
Neijae was the youngest student in her class. She was also the only girl. “I was never intimidated,” she says. 
During the six-week course, Neijae asked her instructor a lot of questions. “If she needed him to say it in a way that she could understand, she did not hesitate to ask,” Graham says. “She’s not afraid to use her voice. She’s not afraid to stand up, to ask questions.” Neijae says she’s usually very talkative, but barbering taught her how to focus.  
What was the most important thing Neijae learned from the course? “Safety first,” she says. “That's always the first thing. Cleaning our tools, that’s the second most important thing. I have to protect myself and the client.”
New Opportunities
After Neijae finished the course, a video of her went viral. Since then, she has had the opportunity to meet professional barbers and celebrities. She traveled to Nashville, Tennessee, to appear on the TV show Pickler & Ben. “I also cut Oprah’s dad’s hair,” Neijae says. (Vernon Winfrey has worked as a barber in the Nashville, Tennessee, area for decades.) But the best part of the trip for Neijae? “The hotel. It was very beautiful.”

Neijae also gives back to the community. Her barbering instructor, P. Michael Boone, works with a group called Barbers Who Care. He’s invited Neijae to attend events with him.  She has given free cuts to members of the homeless community, and she has given back-to-school cuts to kids her age.
Due to barbering regulations, Neijae can’t charge money for cutting hair or work without a licensed barber present until she’s 16. Until then, she plans to continue giving free cuts for charity. Her mom is proud. “It’s a blessing,” Graham says.

861,861,A Salute to Memorial Day,"{'Holidays', 'History'}","
On Memorial Day weekend, families across the United States enjoy warm weather, backyard barbecues, maybe even a trip to the beach. The school year may not be over, but it sure feels like summer.
Yet Memorial Day is not just a time for fun. The national holiday began with a solemn purpose: to remember those who died while serving in the U.S. military. Over time, it took on a more celebratory tone. How did this happen? 
Starting in the mid-1800s, Memorial Day was observed on May 30. It was known as Decoration Day. Its purpose was to remember the 620,000 people killed in the Civil War, which ended in 1865. The first-ever memorial service at Arlington National Cemetery, in Virginia, took place on May 30, 1868. Around 5,000 people were there. Ohio congressman and future U.S. president James Garfield delivered a speech. The soldiers gave their lives “for love of country,” he said, “and made immortal their patriotism and their virtue.” Visitors decorated soldiers’ graves with flags and flowers. 
The serious mood didn’t last long. In 1873, the state of New York declared Decoration Day a day off from work. Businesses were closed. This allowed families to take trips to the beach. Sports fans could go to afternoon games. Soon, other states gave workers the day off too. 
Not everyone was happy about the change. Some worried Memorial Day would lose its meaning. In 1887, President Grover Cleveland made headlines after he was said to have spent the day fishing. 
In 1889, Congress made May 30 a national holiday. As the years passed, fewer American families had ties to the military. A big shift came in 1971, when Congress put the Uniform Holiday Act into effect. The act designated Memorial Day as the last Monday in May instead of May 30. That created a three-day weekend—a mini-vacation. It put people in mind of the upcoming summer. It also put them in the mood to spend. Businesses offered sales to attract shoppers. 
But some Americans have not forgotten the original meaning of Memorial Day. Many Gold Star families still visit a cemetery to pay respects to service members who  their lives. Krissy Stewart lost her husband, Marine sergeant David Stewart, to war in Afghanistan. He left behind two children, McKenzie and Marshall. 
“Memorial Day for Gold Star families is every day,” Stewart says, referring to families who’ve lost a relative in war. “But I’m thankful that we have this day on the calendar. I hope that through our family’s loss, people will pause and reflect that freedom is not free.”

It’s a whole new world in Disney’s remake of the 1992 animated film Aladdin. Most of the story remains the same. A lowly “street rat” meets a genie, falls in love with a princess, and tries to save a kingdom from the evil Jafar. But the new movie is live-action, not animated. And it features dynamic new dance scenes. 
JAMAL SIMS is the film’s choreographer. A choreographer designs the physical movements in a dance. For Aladdin, Sims and his team were inspired to combine different dance styles. “It was fun to incorporate traditional styles of Arabic dancing with hip-hop,” he told TIME for Kids. 
One performance features dancers at a parade. Sims says it was challenging to put together. “We had eight horses, six camels, and other real live animals in this procession with the dancers,” he says. “Everything moving down the street had to move in perfect sync.” 
Sims says he strongly relates to the movie’s theme of being who you are: “Having the courage to show up as yourself and know that you’re good enough is a big thing for me.”

Can you name Norway’s northernmost plateau? Texas eighth grader Nihar Janga can. It’s Finnmark Plateau. By answering that question, Nihar won the 31st annual National Geographic GeoBee on Wednesday. 
The GeoBee is designed to encourage students to learn about the world. Students from grades 4 through 8 can compete for a chance to win college scholarships.
Nihar will receive a $25,000 scholarship and a lifetime membership to the National Geographic Society. He will also take part in an expedition to the Galápagos Islands aboard the National Geographic Endeavour II.
This isn’t Nihar’s first time as a bee champion. In 2016, he shared the top prize with Jairam Hathwar at the Scripps National Spelling Bee. And he was a finalist in last year’s GeoBee.
This week, the National Geographic Society also held finals for its first-ever GeoChallenge. The nationwide team competition challenges students to develop  for urgent problems. This year’s theme was plastic pollution in our waterways. The winning team was from Flushing Christian School, in New York City. The team built a model of a device that would use filters to remove plastic debris from a river. The prize was $25,000. The team members will receive guidance from National Geographic employees as they further develop the project.

864,864,Back to the Moon,"{'Technology', 'Space'}","
NASA is on a mission to put the first woman and the next man on the moon by 2024. On May 16, the space agency took the latest step in that process. It announced the 11 companies selected to help produce advanced human lunar landers. These spacecraft are used to transport astronauts to the moon’s surface during a moon mission.
NASA has named this mission Artemis. In Greek mythology, Artemis is the twin sister of Apollo and goddess of the moon. 
NASA last sent people to the moon on the Apollo 17 mission. That was in 1972. Now, the agency wants to learn if humans can live there. “President Donald Trump has asked NASA to accelerate our plans to return to the moon,” NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine notes on the organization’s website. “This time, when we go to the moon, we will stay.”
The 11 companies NASA has partnered with will study human landing systems and develop models. “Our team is excited to get back to the moon quickly as possible,” said Marshall Smith. He is director for human lunar exploration programs at NASA. Partnering with the companies is “an important step” to achieving that goal, he adds.
The companies have been chosen from eight states. The better-known companies include SpaceX, in California, and Boeing, in Texas. Others include Blue Origin, in Washington; Dynetics, in Alabama; and Lockheed Martin, in Colorado.
NASA has awarded the companies a total of $45.5 million. Each company must also contribute to the total cost of the project. This will reduce costs to U.S. taxpayers. It will also encourage other companies to invest in NASA’s lunar projects.

Biscuits and chocolate gravy are breakfast food in Arkansas. Immigrants from Somalia, in Africa, make meat-stuffed pastries called sambusas in Minnesota. In North Dakota, bees produce about 34 million pounds of honey a year. These are among the delicious little nuggets in United Tastes of America: An Atlas of Food Facts & Recipes from Every State!, by GABRIELLE LANGHOLTZ. She spoke with TFK’s Jaime Joyce.
How did you do the research for this book? 
Well, you might say I’ve been doing the research my whole life. I had been to all 50 states before I started the book. As a kid, my family moved all around. I was born in Indiana. We lived in Kentucky, California, Alaska, Oklahoma, New York, and Virginia. I now live in Pennsylvania. Both my parents were college professors. Their approach to life was always, “Let’s just go see and do all of the things with our kids.” Everywhere we went, it was like, “Let’s taste this crazy barbecue! Let’s go to this Texas steakhouse!” We tried seal blubber in Alaska. Food was always a big part of exploring and experiencing on the way to and from national parks.
What do you hope kids take away from reading this book? 
I hope kids take away that America has regionalism and diversity. When you go to different parts of our big, beautiful country, you have different experiences, different people, different geography, different history, and different cultures and customs. Through food you can learn about all those things.

Can you give examples of some fun things you learned in your research? 
I learned so many fascinating things! A few examples: People in Florida eat alligator, people in Maine eat moose, and people in Colorado eat rattlesnake! Chicago hot dogs are covered in just about everything—except ketchup! And Idaho donuts are made even more delicious by a secret ingredient: mashed potatoes.
For those kids who may be going on a road trip this summer with their families, what are some foods that you want to make sure kids try? 
It depends on where you're going, but I find that seafood, or freshwater fish, is pretty spectacular no matter where you go. If you're up in New England, it's lobster, but also clams and scrod and cod and chowder. And then you come down to Maryland and it’s crab legs that you eat on the shore. And oyster po’boys in New Orleans. 
Also, paw paw. If you go to Indiana or Ohio, find the paw paw. This is a fruit that tastes like banana times passion fruit. You can't buy it in a store, or even in a farmers’ market. It's almost forgotten. Thomas Jefferson and George Washington grew it. It’s so delicious!

You’ve traveled all over the country. You’ve been to all 50 states. You’ve lived in many of them. Is there anything that was really new to you? 
I love learning about Arizona. There’s a whole bunch of super ancient agriculture there. In Virginia, peanut soup. That was a fun one. Buttermilk pie [from South Carolina]. Love that one. I love this Guamanian chicken salad that I got from my childhood friend who’s from Guam. She gave me her mom’s recipe. You can cook your way through this book if you want to, but I hope people will just enjoy reading it, traveling while sitting on their sofa.

The museums of the Smithsonian Institution, in Washington, D.C., house the treasures of America’s past. They also tell the stories of the many people who call the United States home. The millions who visit the capital each year can tour the National Museum of the American Indian. They can visit the brand-new museum celebrating African-American history. But there is no museum representing Asian Americans.
A group of museum directors is trying to change that. On May 18, the Smithsonian Asian Pacific American Center launched a drive to raise $25 million. The museum hopes to establish permanent gallery space on the National Mall, in Washington, D.C.
“The ability to have that visibility and recognition is so important,” says Lisa Sasaki. She’s the center’s director. “There has never been a dedicated space where the public could consistently visit and find out about the history and culture of Asian Americans.”
The launch took place in Los Angeles, California. It had star power. Asian-American actors and musicians were in attendance, including Harry Shum Jr., of the hit film Crazy Rich Asians. California congresswomen Judy Chu and Doris Matsui were there as well. They serve in the U.S. House of Representatives.
The U.S. is home to some 20 million Asian Americans. They make up about 6% of the population. They are the nation’s fastest-growing minority. Asian Americans come from more than 20 countries. The largest populations are from China, India, the Philippines, Vietnam, Korea, and Japan. 
“Museums preserve what’s important to society,” says Laura Lott. She’s president and CEO of the American Alliance of Museums. “They tell our stories, give historical context to contemporary issues, and help us imagine a better future.”

Most speakers at graduation ceremonies offer words of wisdom. But at Morehouse College’s graduation ceremony on Sunday, Robert F. Smith had even more to give. 
“We’re gonna put a little fuel in your bus,” the billionaire technology investor told graduates from the speaker podium. Smith then announced that he would pay all of their student loan . The crowd cheered wildly. Many cried.
Morehouse College is an all-male, historically black college. It’s in Atlanta, Georgia. Martin Luther King Jr. and film director Spike Lee are among its famous graduates. The 2019 graduating class includes nearly 400 students. 
Morehouse students leave with an average debt of $30,000 to $40,000. That’s according to Terrance L. Dixon. He is a vice president of enrollment management at the college. Smith’s gift to the graduates is estimated to be worth between $10 million and $40 million. 
Aaron Mitchom is one of this year’s Morehouse graduates. Before Smith’s announcement, Mitchom estimated it would take him 25 years to pay back his student loans. He was shocked to hear that his debt would be wiped away. “My heart dropped,” he told the Associated Press. “In the moment, it was like a burden had been taken off.”
David A. Thomas is the president of Morehouse College. He says Smith’s gift is . “This frees these young men from having to make their career decisions based on their debt,” Thomas said. “This allows them to pursue what they are passionate about.”
According to Forbes, more than 44 million people in the United States have taken out loans to pay for college. They now owe $1.5 trillion. That number is much higher than it has ever been. 
Smith’s gift is generous. However, “a gift like this can make people believe that billionaires are taking care of our problems,” Anand Giridharadas told the New York Times. He’s a political analyst and TIME editor at large. Giridharadas and others say the U.S. government must fix the student loan .

A shiny silver bunny sculpture just set a world record. The sculpture, titled Rabbit, sold at Christie’s auction house in New York on Wednesday for $91.1 million. Rabbit is the most expensive work of art by a living artist ever sold at auction. 
The work is a three-foot-tall sculpture made of stainless steel. It was created in 1986 by artist Jeff Koons. 
Koons is known for his playful work. He is famous for sculptures of balloon animals and inflatable pool toys. Rabbit is one of his most iconic pieces. “You can think of Koons whatever you [like],” said Alex Rotter of Christie’s. “But this is his best work.” 
In an essay about the sculpture, Christie’s art experts tried to explain the work’s appeal. “It is crisp and cool in its appearance, yet taps into the visual language of childhood,” they wrote. 
The piece that sold on Wednesday is one of four identical Rabbit sculptures created by Koons. It is the only one still owned by an individual. The other three are in museums. Two of those museums are in the United States. The third is in Qatar.  
The sculpture was purchased by art dealer Robert Mnuchin on behalf of a client. Mnuchin is the father of Steven Mnuchin, the U.S. treasury secretary. 
The previous record for most expensive work by a living artist sold at auction was set just six months ago. That’s when a painting by David Hockney sold for $90.3. Before then, the record was held by another Koons work. It was a sculpture of an orange balloon dog that sold for $58.4 million in 2013.

A new museum gives visitors a fresh look at one of our country’s most important monuments. It’s the Statue of Liberty Museum. It opens to the public on May 16. The museum is located on Liberty Island. That’s off the southern tip of Manhattan, in New York City. 
The new museum covers 26,000 square feet. That’s about half the size of a football field. It replaces the previous museum, which was in the statue’s pedestal. This will allow for more visitors than ever before. Each year, more than 4 million people visit Liberty Island. But only about 20% were able to enter the old museum. 
“We looked at this small museum and thought, ‘Wouldn’t it be wonderful to . . . move it out to a place where more people could experience it?’” John Piltzecker said. He is superintendent of the Statue of Liberty National Monument and Ellis Island.
Admission to the new museum is free with the price of a ticket to Liberty Island. Inside, visitors can watch a film about Lady Liberty’s creation. They can also see artifacts, photos, and even the statue’s original, 3,600-pound torch. (That torch was removed in 1984 because of water damage.) A digital station lets visitors record what the Statue of Liberty means to them.
The $100 million project took 26 months to complete. It was privately funded. Those behind it hope that visitors will leave with a new appreciation for the iconic structure. 
“Everywhere you go in the world, anywhere you see something about the United States, you see the Statue of Liberty,” said Stephen Briganti. He is president and CEO of the Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Foundation.
The Statue of Liberty was a gift from France to United States. The American public got its first look at Lady Liberty in 1886.

871,871,Dino Discovery,"{'Animals', 'History'}","
Twenty-one years ago, Sterling Nesbitt discovered the fossilized bones of a dinosaur in New Mexico. He was 16 years old at the time. In a study published on May 6 in the journal Nature Ecology and Evolution, Nesbitt’s discovery has now been identified as a new dinosaur species.  
The dino, known as Suskityrannus hazelae, was a type of tyrannosaurid. That means it was an ancestor of the T. rex. “The small group of tyrannosauroid dinosaurs would give rise to some of the biggest predators that we’ve ever seen,” Nesbitt said. He was the lead author of the study. He works as a paleontologist at Virginia Tech. 
Scientists know that Suskityrannus hazelae was quite small. It was only a little larger than the skull of the T. rex. It weighed about 90 pounds. A T. rex could weigh up to nine tons. 
The discovery fills an important gap in the evolution of dinosaurs. Suskityrannus hazelae roamed the Earth 92 million years ago. That’s more than 20 million years before the rise of the T. rex. “We don’t really have a lot of dinosaurs from this particular time period,” Victoria Arbour told Nova. She’s a paleontologist at Canada’s Royal BC Museum. She was not part of the study. “Anything we find is a huge increase in our knowledge,” she said.
The report about Suskityrannus hazelae comes just three months after North Carolina State University paleontologists reported identifying another tyrannosaurid. It is called Moros intrepidus. It was also a tiny relative of T. rex, and about 4 million years older than Suskityrannus hazelae.

872,872,Trade War Continues,"{'Government', 'World'}","
China will increase tariffs on $60 billion worth of American goods. Tariffs are taxes on imported goods. China announced the tariff increases on Monday. They will take effect June 1. 
The increases are the result of a trade battle between China and the United States. President Donald Trump says China’s business practices are unfair to Americans. He has raised tariffs on $200 billion in goods imported from China. Raising taxes on imported items makes them more expensive. 
China is fighting back. American goods such as soybeans, spinach, computers, and coffee will now be taxed as they enter China. China’s tariffs are meant to discourage people in China from buying American products. 
American and Chinese officials have been working on a deal that would end the trade battle. So far, no agreement has been reached. On Twitter, Trump wrote a message to Chinese president Xi Jinping. Trump said that China “will be hurt very badly” if he does not agree to a deal. 
Larry Kudlow is Trump’s chief economic advisor. On Sunday, he spoke to Fox News. Kudlow said that the tariff increases will help the two countries come to an agreement. “It is a negotiation,” he said. “And part of the negotiation is taking action.” 
Kudlow says China and the United States plan to continue trade talks.

874,874,Giraffes in Danger?,"{'Environment', 'Animals'}","
The giraffe may soon join the lion and elephant on the endangered-species list. In April, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service said it would consider putting it there. The agency said it had “substantial information” that led to that decision. Officials will do an in-depth review before making a final call. 
Designating giraffes as endangered would restrict people from bringing the animals into the United States. It would also set aside federal money. This would be used for conservation efforts.
“Giraffes capture our imaginations from childhood on,” says Tanya Sanerib. She works for the Center for Biological Diversity. “But many people don’t realize how few are left in the wild.” 
Giraffes currently live in 21 African countries. They have been wiped out in at least seven others. Conservationists say habitat loss and poaching are major threats. Since 1985, giraffe populations have decreased by 40%. There are only about 68,000 adult giraffes left. That’s less than a quarter of the African elephant population. 
Some are against listing the giraffe as endangered. Safari Club International is a pro-hunting group. It says any restrictions “would reduce U.S. hunters’ willingness to pay top dollar for giraffe hunts.” The group says that money could be used to buy land to increase giraffes’ habitat. It could also be used to fund anti-poaching programs, the group says.

On May 6, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, Duchess of Sussex, welcomed their first child into the world. The royal baby, a boy, was born just after dawn, at 5:26 a.m. He’s a healthy seven pounds, three ounces. At press time, the infant had yet to be named.
The couple did not follow royal tradition by revealing where the baby was born or posing for photos with him. Instead, an overjoyed Harry announced the good news for TV cameras at Windsor Castle.
“I’m just over the moon,” the 34-year-old prince said. “We’re both absolutely thrilled and so grateful for all the love and support from everybody out there. It’s been amazing.”

The infant is seventh in line for the British throne. He is the eighth great-grandchild of 93-year-old Queen Elizabeth II, Britain’s longest-reigning monarch.
Yet he has already made history. Because his mother is American, the baby is eligible for citizenship in the United States and Britain. He is also the first multiracial baby in the royal family’s recent history.
Harry’s announcement brought cheers from well-wishers gathered outside the grounds of Windsor Castle. “Cheers to the newborn baby boy!” said John Loughrey, 64. “Hip hip hooray!” He was dressed in a British flag and carrying royal-family memorabilia for the occasion.

People love to follow dogs on Instagram. The most popular pups have millions of fans. Many canine accounts are pure fluff. (Pugs in sunglasses!) Others push products. Some promote a cause.
But one Instagram account stands out from the pack. Humanitarian_pup tracks the adventures of a rescue dog named Foxtrot. The goal is to raise awareness about the Rohingya  crisis in Bangladesh.
On August 25, 2017, thousands of Rohingya refugees fled Myanmar for Bangladesh. They went in search of safety. Deadly attacks by the Myanmar military forced the Rohingya to leave their homes. Today, the town of Cox’s Bazar is home to nearly 1 million Rohingya refugees. More than half are children.
“When the crisis first happened and people started streaming across the border, there was a lot of media attention,” aid worker Gemma Snowdon told TIME for Kids. “The whole world knew where Cox’s Bazar was.” Now, she says, “that attention has dropped off.” 
Snowdon works for the World Food Programme (WFP). It’s one of several humanitarian groups helping Rohingya refugees. She and her team were looking for creative ways to put the Rohingya back in the spotlight. 
Then it hit them: Foxtrot! 
From Stray to Star
Foxtrot joined the WFP team in November. That’s when Snowdon and other aid workers were doing a beach cleanup. 
“This little puppy, he just kept following us and following us and he wouldn’t stop,” Snowdon says. “We picked him up and he was absolutely exhausted and really dehydrated.” They gave him fresh water and milk and spent the entire day searching for his mom. Eventually, they took the pup to WFP headquarters, where he stayed overnight.
Foxtrot has been with the WFP ever since.
Humanitarian_pup debuted in February. In his posts, Foxtrot poses with workers who are delivering sacks of rice to the refugee camps. He explains what is being done to prepare for the heavy rains that come each monsoon season. He delivers high-energy biscuits to schoolchildren. 
So far, Foxtrot has more than 4,000 followers. 

Humanitarian_pup is attracting attention. “I’ve had really positive feedback from teachers and parents who say that they look everyday at Foxtrot’s posts and their kids love seeing what he’s up to,” Snowdon says.
How can kids join the humanitarian effort for Rohingya refugees? “If they see something on Foxtrot’s page [that interests them], they can talk to their parents about it. They can talk about fundraising. They can  to their local politicians.”
Starting small is okay too, Snowdon says. “You don’t have to tackle all the big crises in the world. Just being kinder to people on the street, or picking up rubbish—there’s always something that people can do to make this world a bit of a better place.”

Nature is in more trouble now than ever before in human history. More than 1 million species are on the brink of extinction. And species loss is happening hundreds of times faster than it did in the past. 
All of that is according to a new report from the United Nations. It is the first U.N. report to take an in-depth look at the health of the Earth’s plant and animal species. 
The report was compiled by more than 450 researchers. They used 15,000 scientific and government studies to create it. A summary was released today, and the full 1,500-page report will be released later this year.
According to the report, the greatest threat to plants and animals is habitat loss. This happens when humans use land and water for purposes such as farming, fishing, and building cities. According to the summary, three-quarters of Earth’s land-based environment has been “significantly altered by human actions.” 
The summary also says that plastic pollution is 10 times as bad as it was in 1980. And it warns that if global warming continues, climate change could harm species even more than habitat loss. 
Andrew Purvis is one of the authors of the report. He and other researchers say it isn’t too late to fix the problem. “The key to remember is, it's not a terminal diagnosis,” Purvis told the Associated Press.
The authors are calling on nations around the world to strengthen their environmental policies. British scientist Robert Watson led the creation of the report. He says that “transformative change” will be necessary: “Business as usual is a disaster.”

On July 20, 1969, more than 500 million people around the world watched a special event on live TV. They saw grainy black-and-white images beamed back from space. Then they heard the voice of American astronaut Neil Armstrong. He said, “That’s one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.”

Armstrong had just become the first person to walk on the moon. His famous footsteps were the  of a fierce competition. In the 1950s and 1960s, the United States and the Soviet Union raced to achieve  in space exploration. 
Eight years earlier, U.S. president John F. Kennedy challenged the nation to send a person to the moon. NASA accepted. 
To the Moon!

Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins formed the Apollo 11 crew. They were launched into space on July 16, 1969. As they neared the moon, the team split up. Collins was in Columbia. This was Apollo 11’s command module. Armstrong and Aldrin traveled in Eagle. This was the  module. As Collins orbited, Armstrong steered Eagle to a fairly flat area that NASA had named the Sea of Tranquility. When they touched down, he notified Mission Control, in Houston, Texas: “The Eagle has landed.”
Armstrong and Aldrin spent 21 hours and 36 minutes on the moon. They set up science experiments and took rock and soil samples. They also planted an American flag in the powdery ground and left a plaque. It says, “We came in peace for all mankind.”  

The men returned to Earth on July 24, 1969, splashing down safely in the Pacific Ocean. The mission was a success.   
Past, Present, and Future
Collins spoke to TIME for Kids about the historic mission. He described seeing Earth from a distance. “The Earth, from 230,000 miles, is a tiny, bright, shiny object,” he says. “As you look at it, you have this strong attraction to it. Because you know it is your home. Everything you’ve known all your life is right there in a tiny dot. You can blot it out with your thumbnail if you stick it out in front of you.” 

U.S. astronauts last visited the moon in 1972. President Donald Trump has challenged NASA to send the next man—and first woman—there by 2024. The plan is to visit the moon’s south pole. The mission could help NASA send people to another faraway place: Mars. 
Sidebar: Celebrating a Milestone
The Apollo astronauts returned to Earth as heroes. They went on a goodwill tour. It celebrated their achievement. And it showed that the U.S. would share its space knowledge. They traveled around the U.S. and to 24 countries. Below, they’re shown standing in a car in a parade in New York City.

Celebrations continue this summer. July 2019 marks the mission’s 50th anniversary. Events are planned at museums and other locations across the country. The Kennedy Space Center, in Florida, expects a record number of visitors.

Measles is on the rise. As of April 19, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had recorded 626 cases of the disease. This is the second-highest number of cases since 2000. That is when measles was declared eliminated in the United States. The largest number—667—was reported in 2014. Health officials expect this year’s number to surpass that one.
Twenty-two states have reported measles. But more than half of the cases were in New York City. There, officials have declared a public-health emergency. They have asked some schools to  students who have not been vaccinated. In Rockland County, unvaccinated children were briefly banned from public places.
Measles is very contagious, and can be deadly. In 2017, it killed 110,000 people worldwide. It spreads from an infected person’s breath. According to the CDC, someone who is not vaccinated “can catch measles just by being in a room where a person with measles has been.”
A rise in measles has more than one cause. Travelers catch the virus  and bring it back to the U.S. It spreads rapidly where there are unvaccinated people.
Measles is rising worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO) released a report. It said the global number of cases is nearly four times as high as it was last April. WHO points to a lack of vaccinations in some places, such as parts of Africa. And WHO notes another cause of the rise in measles: the spread of misinformation about vaccination.

882,882,TFK Explains: The Mueller Report,"{'United States', 'Government'}","
On April 18, the Mueller report was released to Congress and the public. Here, TFK explains.
What is the Mueller report? 
It is a 448-page report about an investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller. 
What did Mueller investigate? 
During the 2016 presidential election, Russia stole emails from and information about Republican and Democratic leaders. The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) says Russia did this to help Donald Trump win. Foreign interference in U.S. elections is against the law. 
The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) looked into the matter. In May 2017, President Trump fired FBI director James Comey, who was in charge of the investigation. 
Soon after, the DOJ appointed Robert Mueller as special counsel. His job was to answer two questions: Did the Trump campaign work with Russia to influence the 2016 election? And did Trump  justice by trying to control the investigation? Over 23 months, 34 people were charged with crimes. Some have already been convicted.
What did the report conclude?
Mueller did not find evidence of a conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia. Nor did he find clear evidence to show that Trump obstructed justice. 
However, the report lists several actions Trump took in an effort to control the investigation. It says those efforts were “mostly unsuccessful,” but only because people around him “declined to carry out orders.” 
Mueller also cited legal guidelines. They say a president cannot be charged with a crime while in office. But he wrote, “While this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it also does not  him.”
How did we get to this point?
Mueller submitted his report to Attorney General William Barr on March 22. Barr then issued a four-page summary. It said he was clearing Trump of any crimes. But lawmakers and the public pushed to see the report for themselves. Barr released it on April 18.  
Is there anything we still don’t know? 
Some of the report was redacted, or blacked out, by the DOJ. Barr said the redactions include information that is classified, relates to an ongoing investigation, or affects the privacy of people not charged with a crime.
What happens next?  
Democrats have demanded to see the full, unredacted report. Soon, Barr will explain his decisions to Congress.

Tanitoluwa Adewumi, known as Tani, is 8. He fled northern Nigeria with his parents and brother nearly two years ago. They were afraid of terrorist attacks there. When the family arrived in the United States, a church pastor helped place them in a homeless shelter in New York City. Tani’s dad found work selling real estate and driving. Tani’s mom studied to become a home health aide. Tani started going to Primary School 116. There, he learned to play the game that would change his life: chess.
On March 10, Tani won his category at the New York chess championship. He became a state champion for kindergarten through third grade. Tani beat 73 other contestants. Some had practiced with private chess teachers. Tani had practiced on the floor of the homeless shelter.
A reporter from the New York Times wrote an article about Tani. Many people read it. In about three weeks, thousands of people donated more than $250,000 to Tani and his family. The donations were made on the GoFundMe website. People also left messages. “Tani! You are a superstar!” one person wrote.
Selfless Acts
The Adewumi family has decided not to keep the money raised on GoFundMe. They will donate 10% of it to their church. The rest will fund scholarships through a new  named after Tani. “People have come to our aid,” Tani’s father, Kayode, told TIME for Kids. “Now we want to help needy people.”
The family did accept a donor’s offer to pay for a year of housing. On March 19, Tani and his family moved out of the homeless shelter. Now they live in an apartment. “My new home is really, really good,” Tani told TFK. “I have pictures and my trophies in my room.”

886,886,Recess Reform,"{'Culture', 'Community'}","
“We only had one recess today!” Beatrice Dathan complained to her mother after coming home from school one day. That was four years ago. Beatrice’s family had moved from California to Connecticut. In California, Beatrice had 50 minutes of recess daily. In Connecticut, she had only 20 minutes. 
Lucy Dathan is Beatrice’s mom. She wishes Beatrice had more recess time. It “helps kids build relationships and be creative thinkers,” she told TIME for Kids. 
Dathan is now a member of the Connecticut House of Representatives. She is working to pass a state . It would require at least 50 minutes of recess each day. Dathan is one of a growing number of people nationwide trying to give kids more time for recess. 
Clear Benefits
In 2017, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and SHAPE America published a report about recess: Playtime encourages kids to be active. This can build healthy bodies. Plus, physical activity can improve brain function. And recess helps kids form friendships. 

Chris Lineberry has seen the benefits of recess. He is the principal of Stanfield Elementary School, in Arizona. Last year, the state started requiring two recess periods for students in kindergarten through fifth grade. Each school decides how long the periods will be. But since the change, Lineberry has noticed “a deeper level of student .”
The CDC calls for at least 20 minutes of daily recess for elementary school students. The average U.S. school offers 27 minutes of recess. But some schools offer none at all. 
Powerful Voices
Today, at least six states have laws that require elementary schools to provide daily recess. Other states are  similar bills. Kids can help change recess laws too. In Arkansas, kids urged lawmakers to consider a bill that requires 40 minutes of recess.
Izzy Kopsky, 8, is one of those kids. His favorite part of recess? Playing with his friends. But Izzy felt like he didn’t have enough time to do that. So in February, he  before lawmakers. He told them that more recess time allows students to use up extra energy. This could improve their focus in class. “Everyone would learn more,” he added. 

Asa Hutchinson is the governor of Arkansas. He signed the state’s recess reform bill into law on April 1. TFK Kid Reporter Belle Irby was on the scene at the State Capitol that day. 
Hutchinson admires the kids’ efforts. “Young people can have a powerful voice,” he told Belle.  

Sidebar: Test Case
There is pressure on schools to ensure students do well on state tests. That’s why some of them shorten recess. This makes more time for class. Some schools also take away recess as punishment for poor schoolwork.

But cutting back on recess may not be the best way to improve test results. According to the 2017 CDC and SHAPE America report, recess can improve a child’s memory. It can also improve a child’s focus.

889,889,8 Questions for Ellen Oh,"{'Books', 'Arts'}","
Ellen Oh is a writer. In 2014, she cofounded We Need  Books (WNDB). The group promotes books featuring characters from a variety of ethnic and cultural backgrounds. She spoke with TFK Kid Reporter Josh Lee.
1. Why do we need diversity in books?
Books are often our introduction to people and cultures different from our own. In this way, they teach us about empathy. That’s how to combat  and hate.
2. When you were a kid, did you feel that you couldn’t relate to characters in books?
I didn’t find many characters who looked like me or shared my background. But I did relate to them in some ways. In A Wrinkle in Time [by Madeleine L’Engle], there’s a smart, nerdy book girl who’s a lot like me. But something was missing. The first time I saw myself in a book was life-transforming.
3. What was the life-changing book?
 It was The Joy Luck Club, by Amy Tan. I saw a family that was like mine, talking about the immigrant experience. For a long time, I felt like an outsider. People would ask me, “Where are you from?” They thought I couldn’t be American because I didn’t look like them. Reading Tan’s book was the first time I felt like I belonged. 
4. How did that influence your writing?
When I got older, there were more books being published that had characters like me. But there wasn’t a hero. There was no Katniss [of The Hunger Games] for Asians. I decided that if I couldn’t find those books, I would write my own.
5. What does WNDB do to promote diversity?
We give books to schools all over the country. We also have the Walter Award. It’s a celebration of the most outstanding diverse books. 

6. Have you seen more diversity in books since you started WNDB?
Yes. There was a myth in publishing for a long time that books by and about people of color don’t sell. But look at books by Jason Reynolds, Nicola Yoon, Jacqueline Woodson, Kwame Alexander—there’s a market for all of them. This proves that people are hungry for these books.
7. Do you think a lack of diversity in books can discourage writers?
Absolutely. Seeing writers of color empowers young people. 
8. What’s your advice for aspiring writers?
Read a lot of books. That will open up your world. Second piece of advice: Write. Don’t worry if it’s terrible. You can always revise. Just get those words on paper.

James often asks his Dot to tell jokes. He also asks it to play music. And his sister? “She asks for songs from Frozen,” he says.
In December 2017, there were about 67 million smart speakers in homes in the United States. A year later, the number was nearly 119 million. That’s according to a study by National Public Radio and Edison Research.
“Families are interested in trying these products,” says Caroline Knorr of Common Sense Media. But with more kids using smart speakers, privacy worries are growing.
Who’s There? 
Smart speakers are devices such as Google Home and Amazon’s Echo. They give users access to a voice-activated digital assistant.
Common Sense Media did a survey about smart speakers. They talked to more than 1,000 parents with kids ages 2 to 8. The results were announced in March. Nearly half of the parents said their kids use the speakers. Half of those kids use them daily. 
Some parents report having turned off a smart speaker’s microphone. Why? About one-third of them say they did it because they didn’t trust the device.
“A smart speaker might behave like a human in some ways,” says Florian Schaub. He is a professor. He works at the University of Michigan School of Information. “But that’s really a company collecting  about you. Everything you say to a smart speaker is recorded by these companies.”
The recordings are used to help companies  service and ads, Schaub says. If users don’t like this, he suggests muting the speaker when it’s not in use and setting privacy controls.

The elephants stood face-to-face in a cloud of dust. Their big ears fanned out. Their tusks almost locked. 
A group of schoolkids gazed in awe from a truck. They had come from a village just outside Makgadikgadi Pans National Park, in Botswana, Africa. “Are the elephants fighting?” someone asked. 
“No, it’s a game,” another child said. “They’re playing.” 
Kolobetso, 13, was quiet. “She’d grown up with a fear that elephants are dangerous,” Walona Sehularo told TIME for Kids. He was also in the truck. He works with Elephants for Africa (EFA). The group is trying to protect elephants and help people live peacefully alongside them.

In parts of  Africa, elephants roam freely. They often come into contact with people. Many people fear them. Some see them as pests.  between people and elephants is common. 
EFA wants to change that. It hopes to inspire young people to become  leaders. “I want to instill in them a sense of ownership over their environment,” Sehularo says.
Sharing the Land 
Threatened by  in other parts of Africa, elephants have long found safety in Botswana (see “On the Move”). The country has about 130,000 elephants. That is more than any other country in Africa. Many can be found along the Boteti River. 

But elephants also wander onto farms. They eat and  crops. In some cases, farmers respond by killing them. 
Kate Evans is EFA’s founder. “Farmers don’t want to hurt elephants,” she says. “They just want to produce enough crops to feed their families and to sell at market.” 
Change of Heart
Botswana’s elephants attract tourists to Makgadikgadi Pans. But few local children can afford to visit. By leading them on trips there, EFA aims to teach kids to love the park and its wildlife. This might even get kids interested in careers as park officers, guides, or researchers.
When Kolobetso and her classmates toured the park, an elephant headed straight for the truck, defending its herd. Then it walked away. The kids were amazed. “It was one of those moments you cannot explain,” Sehularo says. “It fills you with an indescribable joy.”

What about Kolobetso? She started to have fun. She even said she would like to come back. Sehularo felt he was making a difference. He says, “Many in my country think, ‘Why should I care about the animals?’ But the only way things get better is if people care.”
Sidebar: On the Move

Botswana’s Boteti River flows along the western edge of Makgadikgadi Pans National Park. During the dry season, little water flows in other places. So the river attracts large numbers of elephants.
Researchers say the threat of poaching in surrounding countries has driven more and more elephants into Botswana. Much of the land is protected. For now, the country may be the safest place on Earth for elephants.
Correction: The map that appeared with this story misspelled the name of the river running along the edge of Makgadikgadi Pans National Park. The river is the Boteti, not the Boleti.

The Tappan Zee Bridge, north of New York City, carried automobiles across the Hudson River for 62 years. In 2017, a new bridge replaced it. The old bridge was demolished. Workers picked apart the structure piece by piece. 
Now those pieces are being recycled. Huge chunks of metal and concrete were cleaned. They were taken to one of several locations off the New York State coastline. Then they were dropped into the Atlantic Ocean. The old bridge is starting a new life as an artificial reef. 

Under the Sea
Natural reefs are stonelike underwater ridges. They are made of living things called corals. The reefs serve as a habitat for marine life. They attract tourists to a region. This is good for local economies. Reefs also help prevent . And they protect coastal communities from flooding. “Reefs are great for nature and for people,” Bill Ulfelder told TIME for Kids. He’s with the Nature Conservancy in New York. 
But natural coral reefs are in trouble (see “Coral Crisis”). That’s why people are finding ways to build them from artificial materials. Artificial reefs aren’t made of coral. But they can provide many of the same benefits. Over time, coral may even grow on them. 

Ulfelder’s group works to renew New York waterways, which were harmed by  in the 20th century. In recent years, water quality has improved. Artificial reefs are bringing animals back to the area. 
Help for Troubled Waters 
Artificial reefs are created by placing large objects on the ocean floor. Sometimes, these objects are built to be used as reefs. They are often made of limestone, steel, and concrete. 

A structure can also be recycled as a reef. That’s what happened with the Tappan Zee Bridge. Aircraft carriers, subway cars, and military tanks have all been reused this way. They are first cleaned of materials that could threaten ocean life.
Many artificial reefs are made from old ships. In 2005, Jim Walsh helped turn a ship called the Carthaginian II into a reef. It is off the coast of Hawaii. The reef is now a popular spot for scuba diving, fishing, and submarine tours. 
The Carthaginian II landed on the ocean floor more than a decade ago. Back then, it was just a chunk of metal on a bare patch of sand. Now the ship is home to at least 75 animal species. They include unicorn fish, goatfish, and moray eels. “It’s amazing to see how much life is on that ship,” Walsh says.
Sidebar: Coral Crisis

When coral is healthy, tiny, colorful creatures called algae live on it. The coral protects the algae, and the algae are a food source for the coral. But when ocean water gets too hot or too cold, the algae leave the coral. Without algae, the coral has no food. It turns white. This is called coral bleaching. The world’s largest reef is the Great Barrier Reef, in Australia. About 93% of this reef has been harmed by coral bleaching. Scientists blame climate change and pollution.

897,897,Waste Not,"{'Environment', 'Food and Nutrition'}","
Each weekday, more than 30 million students in the United States eat meals served in school cafeterias. And when lunch is over, they fill the trash cans with uneaten food. 
Half-eaten apples, chicken tenders, and turkey sandwiches come at a cost. That’s why schools are trying to reduce the amount of food that gets thrown away. “We don’t want good food to go to waste,” Nancy Deming told TIME for Kids. She’s the sustainability manager for the Oakland Unified School District, in California.

More than $1 billion worth of food is wasted every year. That’s according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). Wasted food is wasted money. It’s also a missed opportunity to feed hungry people. And it’s bad for the environment: Farming, packaging, and transporting food produces greenhouse-gas emissions. They pollute the air. Plus, food packaging often ends up in a landfill.  
Fighting Food Waste
Schools have developed strategies to cut back on waste. Students are often hungrier after playing. Scheduling lunch after recess can reduce the amount of food that’s wasted by 30%, according to the USDA. Making lunch period longer also helps. It gives kids time to eat everything on their tray. 
Many schools follow government rules that say students must take a certain number of healthy items at mealtime. Those rules help kids get a balanced meal. But they can lead to more waste. 

That’s why Oakland schools set up something called share tables. Students put untouched food on the table. A student who wants the food can take it. There are rules to make sure the food is safe. 
Food that isn’t taken from the table is served another day. If the food can’t be used at school, it’s donated to charity. Food scraps are turned into compost. “It’s about recognizing that food has value,” Deming says.  

Taste Test
Students also waste food because they don’t like how it tastes. Chef Sam Icklan wants to change that. He works with a program in Massachusetts called Chefs in Schools. He helps cafeteria staff develop recipes kids enjoy. 
In one school, kale often went uneaten. Then Icklan made a recipe for pizza topped with kale, zucchini, and spinach. He called it Green Monster Pizza. Students loved it. “It became this beautiful, vibrant dish that was delicious and packed with vegetables,” Icklan says. “Who wouldn’t eat that?”
Sidebar: Join the Fight 

You can fight food waste too. At the grocery store, look for “ugly” produce. Fruits and vegetables with irregular shapes are still tasty, but they are often overlooked. At home, read safety labels. If a label says “best before,” the food is still safe to eat for a little while after that date. (If the label says “use by,” the food is no longer safe after the date.) At mealtime, start with small portions. If you’re still hungry, you can take more later. And when you don’t eat food, don’t throw it out. Turn it into compost!

Do you ride a school bus? If not, you might know someone who does. There are more than 480,000 school buses on the road every day in the United States. Most of them run on diesel fuel. 
Diesel is made from a . It is bad for the environment. Diesel  pollute the air. They may also cause or worsen health problems, such as asthma.
“When kids are on the bus or just at school near buses, they are exposed to diesel fumes,” Matthew Casale told TIME for Kids. He is the director of the 21st Century Transportation campaign for the United States Public Interest Research Group. The group hopes to inspire a switch to electric school buses. 
Electric buses run on batteries. They are plugged into charging stations.  They can run for 150 miles on a single charge. The best news? They are emissions-free. 
“Our goal is to get 100% of school buses electric by 2030,” Casale says.
New Wheels
School districts in California, Massachusetts, and Minnesota are already testing electric school buses. 
Rafael Espinal is an elected official in New York City. He got more than  $1 million for electric buses for the 2019–2020 school year. 
“I thought it made sense to look at how we can electrify our school bus system and improve air quality for our students,” Espinal says. 
Switching will not be cheap. A typical diesel bus sells for about $400,000. An electric bus costs around $750,000. Many school districts can’t afford that price. 
But it costs less to travel in an electric vehicle than in one that runs on diesel. That’s according to the U.S. Department of Energy.
Casale says the choice is clear. He thinks diesel is unacceptable “when we know how bad it is for kids and there are better options out there.”

In 1953, a three-year war on the Korean Peninsula, in East Asia, ended with a  agreement. The agreement established an area dividing North Korea and South Korea. That area is called the demilitarized zone, or DMZ. People are forbidden from entering most of this strip of land. It is 155 miles long and more than two miles wide. 
Today, South Korea is a democracy. North Korea is a dictatorship. Armed soldiers patrol the boundary between them, on both sides of the DMZ. 
But inside the DMZ, life is calm. Without human contact, animals are thriving. Forests have recovered after being destroyed in the war. The area has become a wildlife .
According to South Korea’s Ministry of Environment, the DMZ is home to 5,097 plant and animal species. And 106 of them are endangered or protected. 
The red-crowned crane is one such species. The bird is endangered. It is threatened by habitat loss. But each winter, cranes migrate to the DMZ. 

George Archibald is with the International Crane Foundation. He told TIME for Kids that in 2019, about 1,400 red-crowned cranes spent the winter in the region. That’s nearly half of the bird’s worldwide population. 
Marching On
Uk-Bae Lee lives in South Korea. He wrote and illustrated a book called When Spring Comes to the DMZ. Lee told TFK about marching to the area with the army. “I remember standing guard at the border, overlooking the DMZ,” he says. “My heart was full of pain because of the division across this lovely land.”
The countries are slowly working to fix their relationship. Someday, the DMZ may not be needed. But conservationists hope wildlife will still be protected. “The beautiful things that are created by nature—if they’re destroyed, they may be gone forever,” Archibald says.

Growing up near a beach in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Daniel Botelho felt pulled by the sea. As a boy, he loved underwater diving. He also loved taking pictures of turtles. Twelve years ago, Botelho combined these two passions as an underwater photographer. Now he goes on expeditions all over the world and photographs marine life for different publications. What gives him the courage to dive into sometimes-dangerous waters? “I want to show the world all kinds of beautiful fish and animals, ” Botelho told TIME for Kids. He hopes his work inspires kids to learn more about the ocean. Here, Botelho comments on five of his photographs.

CLOSE ENCOUNTER Botelho usually enjoys diving into the ocean and swimming freely with great white sharks. But on this outing, he took photos from the boat instead. “I observed that they were on the hunt that day,” he says. “I needed to respect the sharks’ comfort zone.”

RISKY BUSINESS When Botelho spotted this Portuguese man-of-war in the waters near his home, he ran to grab his camera. But he forgot one thing: gloves. The creature stung his hand. “I was so happy to take the photo,” he says, “I didn’t really care that I got stung.”

SEA FUN The ocean sunfish is a rare sighting. It spends most of its time in deep waters and is one of the heaviest bony fishes in the world. It’s also shy, so Botelho was surprised when one followed him for an hour. “It was one of the best interactions of my life,” he says. 

GONE FISHING Sardines gather in what is called a “bait ball.” Doing so forms a swirling mass that protects as many fish as possible. But a dolphin can release bubbles from its blowhole. The bubbles create a net that traps the sardines. “It was amazing to see,” Botelho says.

BABY CROC Botelho says that the Okavango River Delta is a dangerous place. Spotting a baby crocodile often means that its many predators, including larger crocs, are lurking nearby. “Watching the baby crocodile catch a breath gave me a sense of how tough its life is,” he says.

Alaysia Thomas is 16. She went to sleepaway camp for the first time last summer. At camp, she rode horses. She also went canoeing. But her favorite thing was talking with other campers. “I made great friendships,” she told TIME for Kids. 
The campers had something in common. They all have a parent in the military. Some, such as Alaysia and her younger sister, Alivia, have two.   
The camp the girls went to is in Virginia. It’s one of several Operation Purple camps across the country run by the National Military Family Association (NMFA). These free, weeklong camps are for kids ages 7 to 17. 

Going to an Operation Purple camp can be a military kid’s first time around other military kids. “It’s a chance for them to come together,” Hannah Pike says. She is an NMFA programs director.
Stephanie Thomas is grateful for Operation Purple. She is Alaysia and Alivia’s mother. She is also in the United States Army. “We  a lot for our country,” she says. “That little bit given back, to take care of our kids—it’s appreciated.”

Military children face unique challenges. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, families in the military might move every two to four years. That means kids can switch schools nine times by age 18. 
At an Operation Purple camp, kids bond with new friends who are facing the same challenges. Also, Pike says each camp has two counselors trained to help military kids. They support campers in need.

On a military-themed day, campers make a Wall of Honor. Alaysia Thomas added a poster about her family to her camp’s display. Is she proud of her two military parents? “Very,” she says.

Halima Aden is the world’s first hijab-wearing international runway model. She spoke with TFK Kid Reporter Maria Suarez about being a fashion model, a role model, and an ambassador for UNICEF, the United Nations Children’s Fund.
1. Your story spread quickly when you wore a hijab in the 2016 Miss Minnesota U.S.A. pageant. What is a hijab?
In Arabic, the word hijab means “covering.” It can look different for each individual. It’s my scarf, but I also wear a turban. Sometimes, I wear hats to cover my head. I like to have fun with it.
2. You’re often described as a “hijabi model.” Is that how you describe yourself?
I definitely describe myself as a hijab-wearing model. But I’m not just a label. I’m a friend. I’m a daughter. There are many characteristics I use to define myself. It’s nice to own your identity. But I’m more than just a girl who wears a hijab.
3. In 2016, you were a pageant contestant. Now you’re a famous model. What changes have you seen in the modeling industry in that time?
I was the first model to wear a hijab, but there are now eight or more other hijab-wearing models. It shows that everybody’s ready for change.
4. Why do we need to see models who look like us?
When I was young, girls who wore the hijab didn’t see someone who looked like them in magazines. Everyone deserves to see someone they can relate to. It’s motivating. You see a bit of yourself in them. 
5. You recently visited the refugee camp in Kenya where you were born. What was that like?
It was extremely emotional. On one hand, I got to go back to the camp I was born in. That came with a whole whirlwind of emotions. But I also gave the first-ever TEDx Talk in a . That was very exciting. I felt grateful. 

6. What do you do as an ambassador for UNICEF?
My goal is to spread the word by sharing my relationship with UNICEF. I was a child like the ones they are trying to help.
7. How do you balance your career as a fashion model with your work as a UNICEF ambassador?
UNICEF is so personal to me. Even if I didn’t get into modeling, whatever else I did would have included that. Fashion is amazing. But UNICEF’s work is a social responsibility I can’t ignore.
8. What does the future hold for you?
To write a book, and to continue working with UNICEF. For sure, I will go back to the camp.

An updated version of this story is available in the March 11, 2022, issue of TIME for Kids.
On February 24, Russian forces launched an attack on Ukraine. The move comes after weeks of Russian troop buildup along Ukraine’s borders.
Volodymyr Zelenskyy is Ukraine’s president. He has urged Ukrainians to remain calm as many people are trying to flee the country for their safety. Zelenskyy says Ukraine will defend itself. He has called on world leaders to provide military assistance and to place sanctions on Russia. A sanction is a kind of punishment. Often, sanctions are designed to hurt a country economically.
World leaders have condemned Russian president Vladimir Putin for his actions. United States president Joe Biden called the attacks on Ukraine “unprovoked and unjustified.” He said he would place new sanctions on Russia that would “impose a severe cost on the Russian economy.”
“This is a dangerous moment for all of Europe, for freedom around the world,” President Biden said at a press conference on Thursday afternoon. 
In Context
Ukraine is a country in Eastern Europe. It shares a long border with Russia, and is home to 44 million people. It is slightly smaller than the state of Texas. Ukraine was once part of the Soviet Union. So was Russia. Ukraine and Russia became separate countries after the breakup of the Soviet Union, in 1991. 
Putin claimed an attack against Ukraine was necessary in order to protect people in two parts of eastern Ukraine. These regions are controlled by separatist groups. These groups want their regions to break away from Ukraine. The groups are supported by Putin. This week, he recognized the two regions as independent republics.
Putin has also accused the U.S. and its allies of ignoring Russia’s demand to stop Ukraine from joining NATO. That’s the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. It’s made up of 28 European countries and two North American countries, Canada and the U.S. By joining NATO, Ukraine would get direct support from these countries.
The U.S. says Russia’s moves are an excuse for a wider invasion of Ukraine. “This was never about genuine security concerns on [Russia’s] part,” Biden said. “It was always about . . . Putin’s desire for empire by any means necessary.” 
Zelenskyy called on Russians to protest Putin’s actions. Thousands of Russians took to the streets on February 24 to demonstrate against their country’s decision to invade Ukraine. About 1,700 people across 53 cities were detained by authorities. 
On February 24, NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg called Russia’s attack on Ukraine “reckless.” “We stand with the people of Ukraine at this terrible time,” he said.

122,122,Derechos de los animales,"{'United States', 'Animals'}","
Es una tarde soleada en el Zoológico del Bronx, en la Ciudad de Nueva York. Un tren monocarril se acerca al pabellón de los elefantes. Un niño da un chillido de deleite cuando una elefanta asiática llamada Happy aparece. Happy bate sus orejas y envuelve su trompa alrededor de la cerca de su recinto. 
El Zoológico del Bronx es uno de alrededor de 60 zoológicos en Estados Unidos donde puedes ver a un elefante. Con el número de elefantes asiáticos bajando cada año —quedan alrededor de 50,000 elefantes en la vida salvaje—, un zoológico podría ser la única oportunidad de ver uno para cualquiera de nosotros.

Pero el Proyecto de Derechos No Humanos (NhRP, por sus siglas en inglés), un grupo de derechos de los animales, dice que Happy se siente sola. Una cerca la separa de Patty, otra elefanta. El contacto a través de una cerca no es suficiente, dice NhRP. Steven Wise es el presidente del grupo. “Nosotros comprendemos lo que la vida [de Happy] significa para ella”, dice, “lo cual es casi nada”. 
Por lo que NhRP está haciendo juicio al Zoológico del Bronx. El grupo dice que Happy debería ser llevada a un santuario donde ella puede tener espacio para circular e interactuar con otros elefantes.

En el caso
El caso de NhRP contra el Zoológico del Bronx es el primero de su tipo en EE.UU. El grupo está confiando en una orden judicial escrita para humanos. Esta dice que una persona que ha sido encarcelada ilegalmente debe ser liberada. El año que viene, el NhRP argumentará en la corte que Happy debería tener el mismo derecho.
Existen investigaciones para apoyar este argumento. En 2005, Happy se convirtió en el primer elefante asiático en pasar la prueba del espejo. Esta prueba se realiza para ver si un animal puede reconocerse, de la misma manera en que una persona lo hace. 
Los expertos dicen que los elefantes son inteligentes y prosperan cuando forman conexiones sociales. Joyce Poole los estudia en África. Mantener uno en una ciudad es “una receta desastrosa”, ella dice. “Como puedes imaginarte, si uno estuviese encerrado detrás de barrotes, no hay mucho para hacer”.

La posición del zoológico
El Zoológico del Bronx dice que Happy está bien cuidada y que la separaron de Patty porque las dos no se llevaban bien. Algunas personas afirman que retirar a los animales como Happy de los zoológicos sería un error. Muchos niños nunca crecerían con una conexión a estos animales. 
Jodi Gibson es la presidente de la Sociedad Zoológica de Milwaukee. Ella dice que vio por primera vez elefantes en un zoológico cuando tenía 6 años. “Para mí, como niña, abrió una puerta”, dice. “Nuestra esperanza más grande es que las personas deseen proteger y preservar a estos animales hermosos”. Según la Asociación de Zoológicos y Acuarios (AZA, por sus siglas en inglés), alrededor de 55 millones de niños visitaban zoológicos cada año antes de la pandemia del coronavirus.

Aun así, las actitudes hacia los zoológicos están cambiando. En 2015, SeaWorld consideró terminar sus shows de orcas asesinas. El parque ha sido criticado por mantener a las criaturas en cautiverio.
Pero los zoológicos llegan a más personas que cualquier otro grupo involucrado en la conservación. Son más importantes que nunca, dice el presidente de AZA Dan Ashe.  
Él siente que, si llegara el momento cuando los niños ya no pueden visitar zoológicos y aprender sobre cómo cuidar a los elefantes, “vendría a un gran costo”.

Otros casos judiciales
En 2014, la Corte Suprema de India llamó la atención cuando dijo que los derechos de los animales están protegidos bajo la constitución de la nación. Al prohibir un festival de lucha de toros, la corte escribió que los animales tienen el derecho de “vivir en un ambiente saludable y limpio”. El mismo año, una corte en Argentina decidió que un orangután llamado Sandra (foto) podía ser liberada de un zoológico. La decisión fue revertida más tarde. Pero Sandra aun así fue llevada a un santuario en Florida.

Hugh Kim, de la Ciudad de Nueva York, empezó a planificar las vacaciones de verano de su familia en marzo. Un destino encabezaba su lista: el Parque Nacional Glacier, en Montana. 
Kim reservó sus entradas en línea. Él tenía que hacerlo rápidamente. “Había alrededor de 4,000 entradas disponibles cada día”, le dijo al pasado Niño Reportero de TFK Jeremy Liew en el parque en julio. “Pero se agotaron en cinco minutos”. Sin una entrada, los visitantes esperaban filas largas y podían entrar en ciertas partes del parque únicamente después de las 5 p.m. 
Glacier es uno de varios parques nacionales de Estados Unidos que usaron un sistema de entradas en la primavera y el verano. El propósito: controlar las multitudes. Este año, muchos parques vieron un número récord de visitantes. En abril, alrededor de 194,000 personas visitaron el Parque Nacional Arches, en Utah. Esto es un aumento del 15% desde abril de 2019. El Parque Nacional Canyonlands, también en Utah, vio un aumento del 30%.

Más turismo es bueno para los negocios en pueblos cerca de los parques. Pero el Servicio de Parques Nacionales (NPS, por sus siglas en inglés) dice que grandes multitudes inusuales están dificultando el control de los visitantes. Muchos se alejan de los senderos e intranquilizan a la vida salvaje. La misión de la agencia es proteger las maravillas naturales de Estados Unidos para que la gente pueda disfrutarlas hoy y en el futuro. Las multitudes están haciendo esta tarea más desafiante, y más importante, que nunca. 
Problemas del Parque
La pandemia de coronavirus podría ser el motivo del interés emergente de Estados Unidos en la naturaleza. El verano pasado, muchos lugares donde las personas iban para su recreación estuvieron cerrados. Pero los parques nacionales permanecieron abiertos. Esto dio a la gente la oportunidad de “redescubrir los parques y enamorarse de ellos”, dice Michael Childers. Es un historiador ambiental en Colorado State University, en Fort Collins. Pero el amor de la naturaleza vino con un precio. “El creciente número de personas y autos es abrumador”, dice Childers. 

En Arches, el portón de entrada se cierra con frecuencia antes de las 9 a.m. porque los estacionamientos están llenos. Muchos visitantes no siguen las pautas del parque sobre cómo proteger la tierra. El año pasado, un guardabosques en el Parque Nacional Zion, en Utah, limpió 14 libras de basura en un área pequeña. También tuvo que retirar grafiti de rocas. 

Sitios culturales sagrados cerca de los parques también fueron dañados. Estos incluyen petroglifos, imágenes talladas en rocas por personas indígenas hace cientos de años. Kelli Jones es una guardabosques en el Parque Nacional Grand Canyon, en Arizona. Ella es de la tribu Navajo. Jones recuerda a los visitantes que los navajos son una de las 11 tribus nativo americanas que llaman al Gran Cañón su hogar. “El cañón tiene una conexión cultural con las tribus”, dice. 
Dar el Ejemplo 
Más apoyo del gobierno de EE.UU. ayudaría a los parques, dice Frank Jahn. Él es un guardabosques en Glacier. “Con fondos, podríamos contratar a más personal. Luego, podríamos manejar el número de personas que entran”. 

Pero el dinero no es lo único que protegerá a nuestros parques nacionales. Los visitantes comparten una gran parte de esta responsabilidad (lee “Turismo responsable”). “Una manera de respetar la tierra sagrada es ser un custodio”, dice Jones. “Tú deberías dar el ejemplo positivo para otros que visitan los parques nacionales después de ti”.	
Turismo Responsable

El Servicio de Parques Nacionales tiene una lista de siete principios para no dejar rastros. Estos son cinco consejos. Síguelos para proteger a la vida silvestre de Estados Unidos. 
1. Conoce las reglas para el área que visitarás.
2. Recoge toda la basura, restos de alimentos y desechos de los lugares de campamento.
3. No sigas ni te acerques a la vida salvaje.
4. Evita tocar estructuras culturales o históricas.
5. Respeta otros visitantes y protege la calidad de su experiencia.

324,324,Meet an Activist,"{'Young Game Changers', 'Community'}","
Rebekah Bruesehoff, 14, enjoys playing field hockey, baking, and reading fantasy books. She's also an activist. Rebekah  for transgender rights. People who are transgender don't identify with the gender assigned to them at birth. ""When I was born, everybody thought I was a boy,"" Rebekah told TIME for Kids. ""But I deeply know myself to be a girl. It's just who I've been forever.""
At age 8, she changed her  and started going by Rebekah. ""When I went out in the world as Rebekah, that really changed everything for me,"" she says. ""It made me happier, more confident, and I just felt like me.""
Two years later, in 2017, Rebekah made headlines after speaking at a rally for transgender children's rights in her home state of New Jersey. Ever since then, she's been using her voice to make a difference.
Stand Up, Speak Out
To Rebekah, being an activist means speaking up about a topic or cause you care about. She advocates for transgender and all LGBTQ rights in the hope that all kids can be themselves and feel safe and accepted. ""I know kids like me aren't always supported in their communities,"" Rebekah says. ""So I knew I needed to fix that.""
Rebekah speaks to groups, writes articles, and meets with leaders and politicians. In 2018, she spoke at the New Jersey state legislature in support of a bill that called for schools to teach a more inclusive curriculum. Last month, Rebekah was a special guest at the swearing-in ceremony of Delaware senator Sarah McBride. McBride is the first openly transgender state senator in United States history.
In 2019, Rebekah was featured in an episode of Marvel's Hero Project, a streaming series that highlights kids who are doing amazing things in their community. That same year, she began what is now one of her passions: her book drive. Rebekah collects books with LGBTQ characters, because ""representation matters,"" she says. She donates the books to libraries and schools in need of inclusive stories. The book drive is one way Rebekah works to shatter stereotypes about transgender people. ""Transgender kids are just like everybody else around you,"" she says. ""It's probably the least exciting part of me.""
Rebekah has a message for kids struggling to be accepted for who they are. ""You are not alone, and there are people fighting for you,"" she says. ""There are people who will love you no matter who you are.""

The whole world watched in awe when humans first walked on the moon, in July 1969. The Apollo program was one of the most incredible feats in human history. How We Got to the Moon, written and illustrated by John Rocco, tells the story of the people and technology that carried astronauts safely there and back. “For every astronaut, there are tens of thousands of supporting engineers,” Rocco told TFK. “And what they’re doing is just as important.”
Rocco uses detailed illustrations to tell the story. To get it right, he spoke with Apollo engineers who specialized in rocket engines, space suits, parachutes, and more. Rocco says the book is “not so much about the actual astronauts and their journey but about everything the engineers did to figure it out.”

452,452,Let's Talk! With Daniel Nayeri,"{'Books', 'Time Off'}","
Author Daniel Nayeri talks with TFK Kid Reporter Abby Rogers about his new book, Everything Sad Is Untrue (A True Story).
1. Tell me about the book.
It’s an autobiographical novel about my family. I grew up in Iran and my mother converted to Christianity. In Iran, that is illegal. We had to leave Iran very quickly and became refugees. The story begins when we found asylum in Oklahoma.
2. You talk a lot about your mom in the book. What’s the most valuable thing you learned from her?
There’s a line about my mom that is important to me. It says, “One thing to know about my mom is that she doesn’t stop, and if you don’t stop, you are unstoppable.” I would watch my mom come home exhausted from work. But every day, she would wake up and go back. 
3. What do you hope readers will gain from reading your book?
I wanted to put this question to the reader: “What in your life would you make a big sacrifice for?”  
4. You say that “patchwork memory is the shame of a refugee.” Can you explain that?
Families make memories together and pass them down to keep the memories alive. That is how your family has a linear memory. When you become a refugee, you’re plucked off the family tree and put somewhere new. You cut the line, start it new, and everything is sort of patchwork. You try to hold onto a memory, but you forget. To me, the hardest part of being a refugee is having a patchwork memory.
5. What kept you motivated while working on this book?
Imagine you had a dad who could jump over a house, but you were the only one who knew it. It would be so difficult not to tell people. I felt I had a mom who did this great thing. She changed the world for me. I wanted to tell the story for my mom.

509,509,8 Questions for Dorothy Jean Tillman,"{'Young Game Changers', 'Science'}","
Dorothy Jean Tillman earned a college degree online at 12 and a master’s degree in environmental science at 14. This summer, she’s running a camp in Chicago, Illinois, to bring science and the arts to kids who’ve been cooped up during the pandemic. She spoke with TFK’s Brian S. McGrath about her education and why she’s sharing it with others.
1. How have you achieved such a high level of education?
I started homeschooling at a very young age. It was freeing, because I was able to make my own hours and still get all my work done. I finished high school courses by the time I was 9.
2. Do you miss being in school with other kids?
I miss the social dynamic. But I do things to make up for it. For instance, I keep myself immersed in the arts. That keeps my social life active. In the afternoon, I go to a dance program. To find balance in life, you have to do what works for you.
3. You have degrees in psychology, humanities, and science. Why all of these?
I think these subjects are connected. Psychology and the humanities teach you to have empathy, to understand people. That can help a scientist understand why people treat the environment the way they do.
4. Why did you start a STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts, and math) camp for kids in Chicago?
I believe I should be helping the people who put me where I am. Young Black kids don’t get a fair fighting chance. They don’t get introduced to subjects like technology. Some boys might get a chance to work their way into the field of engineering. But girls barely get their toe into the water. They need to see people like me, to see that I’m young and doing these things.
5. You’re also starting STEM labs in South Africa.
Yes, I went there with my mom, Jimalita Tillman. She’s the global director of the Harold Washington Cultural Center, in Chicago. I met girls who loved academics, like I did. But they didn’t have the same resources. 
I thought something had to be done. I got all my notes together, brought them to my mom, and said, “This is something I really want to do.” We started a GoFundMe page and approached other donors [too]. These labs will have a similar setup as the STEAM camp, but it will go year-round. The projects will be bigger.
6. Your grandmother taught you a lot, didn’t she?
My grandmother is Dorothy Jean Tillman—I was named after her. She is a former politician in Chicago. She fought alongside Martin Luther King Jr. in the 1960s. You had to be a scholar to join his organization. My grandmother was 16 at the time. King told her, “If you’re going to do all these things with me, you’re going to have to finish school and go to college.” She brought me up with those ideals. I wouldn’t be where I am today if it wasn’t for my determination, and I got that from her.
7. Tell us about the book you’re working on.
It’s called Unlock the Jeanius Within. It will contain [quotes] from people I have found inspirational, or who have helped me along the way. I think real wisdom is understanding where you want to be and being able to communicate that.
8. What will you do next?
There isn’t any one thing that I have to do. I’m only 14. I have so much time to decide.

Lois Lowry is one of America’s most celebrated authors. In the course of her career, she’s published more than 30 books.
Lowry’s latest is On the Horizon. It’s her first work of poetry. “When I sat down to begin to write about the things in the book, they sort of floated up in my imagination . . . and they wanted to be written in a different way,” she told TFK Kid Reporter Nora Wilson-Hartgrove.
On the Horizon is about World War II. It describes soldiers in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, and ordinary people in Hiroshima, Japan. The book also tells of kids who lived through the conflict. One was Lowry. She grew up in Hawaii and Japan. On the Horizon challenges readers to reflect on war and imagine a world without it.

637,637,Banned Bags,"{'Business', 'Environment'}","
A ban on single-use plastic bags went into effect in New York State on March 1. New York is one of several states to forbid stores from handing out plastic bags at checkout. California was the first. Many cities and counties across the country have put in place similar laws.
New York governor Andrew Cuomo proposed the ban last year. “For far too long, these bags have  our environment and clogged our waterways,” he said.
Officials say the ban will make people more aware of their shopping habits. Until now, New Yorkers used 23 billion plastic bags each year. The litter is harmful to birds and  animals. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency says some communities spend $1 million each year cleaning up litter. Much of it is plastic grocery bags.
Starting April 1, New York businesses could pay up to $500 for breaking the law. Paper bags are still allowed. But they may cost shoppers 5¢ each.
New York State leaders say people should keep reusable bags handy in their car or backpack. For small purchases, shoppers can help the environment by saying “No, thank you” to a paper bag. They can carry the item instead.
Stop and Think! Why might news about a law in one state be of interest to people across the country? Could such a story influence other states to pass a similar law? Why or why not?

It’s 1880, and 14-year-old Hanna is beginning a new life with her father in the small town of LaForge, in the Dakota Territory. But the townspeople are not happy with their arrival. Hanna is half Asian, and the locals reject her because of her race. In Prairie Lotus, a work of historical fiction, Hanna must persevere in order to achieve her goals. She wants to go to school, work in her father’s shop as a dressmaker, and find a friend.
Newbery Medal–winning author Linda Sue Park says Prairie Lotus was inspired by the Little House series, by Laura Ingalls Wilder. “I wanted to preserve what I love about those books,” Park told TFK. “But I wanted to tell that story through a different lens.”

656,656,Banana en riesgo,"{'Business', 'World'}","
Las bananas son uno de los cultivos más importantes en la Tierra. Según la Organización de Alimentos y Agricultura (FAO, por siglas en inglés), 400 millones de personas dependen de las bananas como una fuente de alimento o ingreso. Pero las bananas que conocemos y amamos podrían estar en peligro de extinción. 
Alrededor del mundo, las plantas de bananas están muriendo a una tasa alarmante. Están siendo atacadas por una forma de la enfermedad de Panamá llamada Raza 4 Tropical (R4T).
Los granjeros, expertos y líderes industriales han temido el día en que R4T llegaría a América Latina y el Caribe. Alrededor del 85% de las bananas exportadas en todo el mundo crecen ahí. El 8 de agosto de 2019, estos temores se hicieron realidad. Colombia declaró una emergencia nacional cuando se confirmaron casos de R4T en seis granjas de bananas en el país.“En Colombia, [R4T] es increíblemente difícil de controlar”, dijo el científico James Dale a TIME for Kids. “Todos están totalmente petrificados acerca de lo que ocurrirá”.

Cuando bananas buenas se ponen malas
R4T es un hongo que vive en el suelo. Afecta a las plantas de bananas a través de las raíces y pasa a los tallos. Ahí, previene que el agua y los nutrientes lleguen a las hojas de la planta. La planta se pone amarilla, luego se seca y muere. 
Puede llevar de seis meses a un año para que los granjeros detecten a R4T en un campo de plantas de bananas. Para entonces, es difícil tratar la enfermedad. Los granjeros solo pueden tratar de evitar que se propague. Pero R4T se propaga fácilmente, de planta a planta y de granja a granja. “Con el aumento del transporte humano, viaje y comercio... ningún país es inmune a la enfermedad”, dice Fazil Dusunceli de FAO. 

Parte del problema es que el 99% de las bananas exportadas son de la misma variedad: Cavendish. Esto es útil para la industria de bananas. Las compañías grandes pueden plantar más bananas cuando solo crecen un tipo, lo cual significa que pueden hacer más dinero. Pero la falta de diversidad no es buena para la naturaleza. Todas las bananas Cavendish son genéticamente iguales. Por esto, cuando una enfermedad como R4T golpea, todas son igualmente vulnerables. 
“Comer Cavendish [bananas] está empeorando la situación”, dice Altus Viljoen, un profesor que estudia enfermedades de plantas. Viljoen y otros expertos dicen que debemos diversificar el tipo de bananas que plantamos y comemos. Esto podría significar comer bananas menos comunes, como la Manzano, la cual tiene sabor a manzana y fresa. 
Un futuro incierto
Las personas en la industria de bananas se están uniendo para tratar de salvar a la fruta tropical. James Dale, por ejemplo, está trabajando con un equipo de científicos en Australia para presentar una variedad de banana que es resistente a R4T. Pero algunas personas están en contra de la creación de nuevos tipos de plantas en un laboratorio. Dicen que las personas no deberían intervenir con la naturaleza. 

No todos están preocupados por la fruta. “Creo que hay un gran futuro para las bananas”, dice Andrew Biles. Él es un asesor de Chiquita, una de las compañías más grandes de bananas en el mundo. “Podrían costar un poco más [en el futuro], pero ya son uno de los artículos más económicos en las tiendas"".
Esta no es la primera vez en la historia que las bananas han estado en peligro (lee la nota de recuadro “Vista al pasado”). Hasta si encontramos una solución a la crisis de bananas de hoy, ¿podría repetirse la historia, una vez más, en las próximas décadas? “Oh, estoy seguro que lo hará”, dice Dale.
Vista al pasado

Antes de los 1950, casi todas las bananas cultivadas para exportar eran de una variedad: Gros Michel. Luego, golpeó la enfermedad de Panamá. La industria de las bananas necesitaba un reemplazo. Por lo tanto, recurrió a un tipo diferente de banana: la Cavendish. Esta era similar a la Gros Michel. Pero era resistente a la enfermedad de Panamá.
En los 1990, una nueva cepa de la enfermedad de Panamá, R4T, golpeó a los cultivos. Esto colocó a la fruta nuevamente en riesgo.

680,680,Martin Luther King Jr.,"{'TFK Library', 'History'}","
Martin Luther King Jr. (January 15, 1929—April 4, 1968) is considered one of history’s greatest speakers and social activists. His leadership in peaceful protests helped end segregation during the American civil rights movement.
When Martin Luther King Jr. was born, his parents, Michael and Alberta, gave him a different name from the one we know today. They called him Michael. But Michael Sr. later changed his name and his son’s to Martin Luther, after the famous religious leader. The middle-class family was very religious. Both Martin’s father and grandfather were pastors in Atlanta, Georgia. The King children grew up in a loving home but experienced racism from an early age.
Separate Is Never Equal
King attended segregated public schools in Georgia. He skipped the ninth and eleventh grades and graduated from high school at 15. It was around that time that he joined the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), a civil rights organization. King’s father led the NAACP’s Atlanta chapter.
In 1948, King graduated from Morehouse College, in Atlanta. He went on to study religion at Crozer Theological Seminary, in Chester, Pennsylvania. In 1951, he graduated with honors and was class valedictorian. Soon after, he enrolled in a Ph.D. program at Boston University (B.U.), in Massachusetts. He met music student Coretta Scott in Boston. The couple married in 1953 and later had two sons and two daughters. 
In 1954, while completing his degree, King moved to Montgomery, Alabama. He became pastor of the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church. Soon after, on December 1, 1955, a woman named Rosa Parks was arrested after refusing to give her seat to white passengers on a Montgomery city bus. In response, the NAACP chose King to lead a citywide bus boycott. For 381 days, members of the black community walked or carpooled to work. Many of them were attacked. 
The NAACP filed a lawsuit against the city of Montgomery. They argued that segregation on city buses was unconstitutional. On November 13, 1956, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that such segregation was indeed illegal. The court based its decision, in part, on Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas. In that case, the court concluded that “separate is never equal.”  
One year later, King, along with 60 ministers and activists, founded the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). 

“I Have a Dream”
In the spring of 1963, King organized a protest in Birmingham, Alabama. The event drew nationwide attention. That’s because city police officers blasted participants with fire hoses and let attack dogs loose. King and others were jailed. 
After their release, King and other civil rights leaders laid plans for a demonstration in the nation’s capital. The March on Washington attracted more than 200,000 people. On August 28, 1963, at the Lincoln Memorial, King gave his “I Have a Dream” speech. He spoke of a day when all men would be treated equally. King went on to win the 1964 Nobel Peace Prize. He was 35 years old and the youngest person to have received the honor. 
Reaching the Promised Land
The fight for equal rights, however, was far from over. On March 7, 1965, demonstrators set off on a 54-mile march, organized by King, from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama. The event became violent when police met marchers with nightsticks and tear gas on the Edmund Pettus Bridge, in Selma. Seventeen people ended up in the hospital. King was not present, but he watched the scene unfold on TV. Soon after, President Lyndon Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The law stated that all citizens had a right to vote, no matter the color of their skin. 
On April 3, 1968, King traveled to Memphis, Tennessee, in support of striking sanitation workers. In a speech there, he said, “I’ve seen the Promised Land. I may not get there with you. But I want you to know tonight, that we, as a people, will get to the Promised Land.” The next day, he was shot while standing on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel, where he was staying. The assassination ended King’s life. He was 39 years old. It sparked riots in more than 100 cities. The accused shooter, James Earl Ray, pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 99 years in prison. 
“I’ve seen the Promised Land. I may not get there with you. But I want you to know tonight, that we, as a people, will get to the Promised Land.” — Martin Luther King, Jr.
In the United States, King’s birthday is observed as a national holiday on the third Monday in January. On that day, many Americans volunteer at shelters, schools, hospitals, and other community organizations to honor the civil rights leader’s legacy of service and commitment.

1. How did you get your start in acting?
When I was 5, my family and I were having holiday photos taken at a mall in Texas. The photographer was impressed with the way I posed and presented myself. He made my parents promise to show the photos to an acting agency. They did, and the rest is history.
2. How did you make the decision to start your own film production company, Genius Productions?
There aren’t a lot of young black girls in the film industry, and opportunities are limited. My parents and I wanted to create a company that’s diverse and , not just of black girls, but also of anyone who is underrepresented. 
3. What do you do as the head of your company? 
As a , I get to create things. I come up with ideas for projects, and my team helps me decide what works and what doesn’t work. They guide me throughout the process. They help me to be creative. Creativity is about letting your mind go beyond what you thought was possible. 
4. How do you balance your work in television and movies with schoolwork? 
I work with a tutor when I’m on the set of a movie or TV show. Between takes, I do my schoolwork. It definitely helps that I can work on my own time.
5. Who would you say has influenced your career the most, and why?
Definitely my family. They have done so much for me. My mom and dad are very protective of me. That’s what makes us the power group that we are. We don’t take no for an answer, and we keep pushing for what we believe in. My baby sister is the reason I do this work. I want to inspire other young girls like her.
6. What do you like to do in your free time? 
I love catching up with my friends. I love going back to my hometown, in Texas, back to my roots, to remind myself where I came from. I like to swim and dance, to eat and sleep. The normal stuff. 
7. Where do you see yourself in 10 years? 
I try not to think about that. I just want to take it one step at a time. Wherever I’m headed, I’m sure I’ll be happy, because I have love and support on my side.
8. What encouragement would you offer to young people who have big dreams?
Be yourself. You can do whatever you want, if you tap into your full potential. And take care of yourself. Whatever you do, whether it’s acting or going to school—make sure to take time to relax. Mental health is important.

789,789,Pure Magic,"{'Movies and Television', 'Time Off'}","
Jim Henson, the creator of the Muppets, released the movie The Dark Crystal in 1982. It tells the story of a planet that’s home to birdlike creatures called Skeksis, wise wizards called Mystics, and peaceful elves called Gelfling. Now, 37 years later, The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance returns to the world Henson created. 
The new Netflix series is a prequel to the 1982 film. It’s designed for parents and kids to watch together. The show was directed by LOUIS LETERRIER (pictured). Leterrier told TIME for Kids that when he saw The Dark Crystal, at age 10, it inspired him to become a filmmaker. “My mind was completely opened up by that movie,” he says. “I watched it and said, ‘I want to do that.’”
The 10-part series features 180 puppet characters and 90 sets. The puppets are voiced by actors and controlled by puppeteers. But no humans appear onscreen, and computer animation is rarely used. “We wanted to create a love letter to the art of puppetry,” Leterrier says. “I think puppetry is pure magic.”

856,856,Meet the 2019 National Teacher of the Year,"{'United States', 'People'}","
Rodney Robinson will tell you his students are no different from any other students. (“They’re just goofy teenagers.”) He’ll tell you his classroom is no different from any other classroom. (It’s decorated with motivational quotes and colorful college banners.) But Robinson will admit that his school is different. Why? He teaches at Virgie Binford Education Center, in Richmond, Virginia. The school is inside a juvenile detention center. That’s a place for young people that functions like a jail. 
Robinson teaches history and social studies to students in grades 6 through 12. Pupils are 11 to 18 years old. Some are at Virgie Binford for skipping class at their regular school. Others have been accused of serious crimes. Students come for as little as two days. Others are here for as long as two years. Most stay for about 30 days. That's according to principal Ta’Neshia Ford. “No matter how long they’re with us,” Robinson told TIME for Kids, “we’re going to do what’s best for them and get them on the right path.” 
“My goal is for my students to become civic-minded, socially conscious change agents,” he says. “I just want them to learn about themselves, their culture, and their history, and hopefully to inspire and  them to be that change agent.”
Robinson is getting lots of attention for his work at Virgie Binford. In April, he was named 2019 National Teacher of the Year. He went to Washington, D.C., to receive the award. It was presented to him at the White House by U.S. secretary of education Betsy DeVos. 
“America is a country of second chances,” Robinson said in his speech. “And students in jail deserve a high-quality education just as much as any student in America.”

Man on a Mission
Since 1952, the Council of Chief State School Officers has selected a National Teacher of the Year. Winners use their time in the spotlight to raise awareness about important issues. Robinson will focus on  students. “These are students whose stories are not normally told,” he says. “I want to bring that voice to the table and  for their needs.”
What they need, Robinson says, is “economic investment into their communities, jobs, mental-health services, academic counseling.” He hopes people will start to see juvenile detention in a more positive light. He sees it as an opportunity for young people in trouble to “reset and refocus.”
“His platform is really one of equity,” says Jason Kamras. He’s superintendent of Richmond Public Schools. “If there’s any kid out there who feels like they don’t belong, or that the deck is stacked against them, Rodney is out there, fighting for you.”

Robinson taught at Richmond’s Armstrong High School for 11 years before coming to Virgie Binford. Doron Battle and Hubert Anderson were two of his students. “He’s a superhero,” Battle says. “He’s one of those people that if there was a movie about him, you would root for him.” Anderson agrees. “Having a great teacher like Rodney Robinson has helped me and thousands of other students get to where we are today.” 
Both men now teach at George Mason Elementary School, in Richmond. They’ve helped fulfill one of Robinson’s missions. He wants there to be more teachers of color. Richmond Public School students are 71% African American. 
Classes at Virgie Binford end on June 14. Robinson will then begin his National Teacher of the Year tour. But for now, it’s business as usual. “The main thing I try to teach my students is to always expect the best and demand the best of all your teachers and everyone who is there to help you,” he says. “Never let anyone dim your light or dim your voice.”

896,896,Notre-Dame Burns,"{'Places', 'World'}","
The iconic Notre-Dame , in Paris, France, was ravaged by fire on April 15. The building’s  and most of its wooden roof were destroyed. But the cathedral remained standing when the blaze was extinguished, more than 12 hours after it began. Its famous bell towers and much of its inside were spared.
Construction on Notre-Dame began in the 12th century. It is a Roman Catholic church, but it is also an architectural treasure, a French landmark, and a tourist attraction. Some 13 million people visit Notre-Dame each year. 
“It’s the very soul of Paris, but it’s not just for French people,” said Barbara Drake Boehm, of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, in New York. “For all humanity, it’s one of the great monuments to the best of civilization.” 
Authorities are treating the fire as an accident, and say it may be linked to a renovation project that was underway. Some 500 firefighters battled the blaze. About a hundred of them worked to save as many art and religious objects as possible. 
Among the rescued artifacts is a crown of thorns believed to have been worn by Jesus. Notre-Dame’s world-famous stained-glass windows and pipe organ also survived. 
French president Emmanuel Macron pledged to rebuild. “Notre-Dame of Paris is our history, our literature, our imagination,” he told reporters. At press time, donors had pledged nearly $1 billion for the restoration effort.

Trevor Noah is the host of The Daily Show on Comedy Central. He is also the author of a best-selling memoir about growing up in South Africa. It has been published in a young readers’ edition, It’s Trevor Noah: Born a Crime. (This book is recommended for ages 11 and up by Common Sense Media.)
Noah is the son of a black mother and a white father. His parents’ relationship was illegal under apartheid, a system of laws in South Africa that mandated the separation of races. In his memoir, Noah writes about how, for much of his early life, his parents hid him away indoors, where he spent his time reading and inventing imaginary worlds.
Most of all, It’s Trevor Noah: Born a Crime is a testament to the love and determination of his mother, Patricia. She taught her son to use wit and education to rise above poverty and racism. She named her son Trevor because it was “a name with no meaning whatsoever in South Africa, no precedent in my family,” he writes. “My mother wanted her child beholden to no fate. She wanted me to be free to go anywhere, do anything, be anyone.”
Noah sat down with TFK Kid Reporter Roman Peterson to talk about his memoir and about how a child under apartheid in South Africa rose to become a successful comedian.

Your memoir was a New York Times bestseller. Why did you want to create a version of the book for young readers?
So many kids were already reading the book. A lot of parents told me that they were reading it to their kids. They’d say, “Hey, we would love to give our kids the book, but parts of it are a little too complicated. If you could change some of the language, then every kid would be able to read the story.”
A lot of the book is about me as a young kid, growing up in South Africa and going to school. It made perfect sense to make a book for young readers who may be leading a similar life, just in a different country.
What kinds of books did you read when you were growing up?
I loved fantasy. I loved Roald Dahl, especially “The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar” and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. I also love the Narnia series by C.S. Lewis. My mom always made sure I had tons of books in the house. Even if I didn’t have the best toys, I had books. Books can take you anywhere. You can use your imagination.
Kids might be intrigued by your book’s title. What does it mean to be “born a crime”?
When I was born, there were laws in South Africa that made it illegal for people of different skin colors to get married. My mother is a black woman, my father is a white man, and there is nothing wrong with people of different skin colors getting married. But at that time in South Africa, it was against the law. My parents didn’t care about those laws. They fell in love, and they had me. So even though there was nothing wrong with what they did, I was born a crime. My parents had to hide the fact that I was their child. Luckily, those laws have since changed in South Africa, so no one else has to be born a crime.

Apartheid is a central part of South Africa’s history. What is apartheid? How did it work?
Apartheid was a system of laws that gave people different rights depending on the color of their skin. If you were white, you would live a different life from someone who was black or Asian, for example. Apartheid made no sense. We know there’s no difference between people based on skin color. But at that time, it was the law. It affected everything. Kids couldn’t go to school together if they were of different races. Apartheid determined what jobs you could get, whom you could marry, and where you could travel within the country—all because of the color of your skin. Thankfully, things have changed. But history reminds us of how people can hate each other based on nothing.
You weave a lot of the history of South Africa into your memoir. How can history help us understand ourselves?
A lot of things happening in the world today are very similar to things that happened a long time ago. If we spend time remembering what happened before, we can try to make sure that bad things don’t happen again. It’s very similar to how we live our lives as people: If you remember touching the stove and getting burned, you don’t touch the stove again. It’s important for people to remember the bad things that happened in the past so they don’t repeat these things in the future.
You say in the book that to survive, you had to become a chameleon. What does that mean?
When I was growing up, my mom and I moved around a lot. I always found myself in schools and neighborhoods where I didn’t fit in. I looked different from a lot of kids, and I often spoke differently. When you’re growing up, and even when you are older, you want to fit in. I had to learn how to fit in with other people, so they wouldn’t keep seeing me as an outsider. I had to learn how to speak other languages. I had to learn about different cultures. And I realized it was easier for me to change than it was to change the world I was living in. At first, this was a burden. But when I got older, I realized that this was a great lesson to learn. I learned to understand other people, so that I could help them understand me.
Many times in the book, you say that in figuring out who you are, life will force you to pick a side. Can you explain what that means?
Unfortunately, even if you decide you don’t want to choose a side in an argument, the world is, at some point, going to force you to pick a side. The world will force you to live in a particular way. Take skin color: People will force you to live in a particular box [because of that]. Even if you feel that you don’t fit into that box, most of the time people want you to be in that box. When I was growing up, I never thought of myself as black or white. I didn’t identify with any race. My dad was white, my mom was black, but I didn’t see them like that. I just saw them as my dad and my mom.
When I got to a certain place in my life, I realized that I had to make decisions based on how those decisions were going to affect me. The easiest way to think of it is like sports teams at school. You might just see yourself as a baseball player or a basketball player. But at some point, someone is going to say to you, “Which team are you on?”
What advice can you offer kids who don’t fit in?
Not fitting in is sometimes the best thing that can happen to you. If everybody fits in, then what makes you special? If you feel that you don’t fit in, or feel like you’re a strange kid, make that strange thing your magic. For instance, Harry Potter didn’t fit into his world. That’s what made him magical. He found out that he was a wizard. Think about what makes you a wizard in your world, and don’t worry about fitting in, because the thing that makes you different might make you the most special person of all.

How did the experiences in the book lead you to becoming a comedian?
I became a comedian because I love to make people laugh. That started very young. I loved making kids laugh at school, making teachers laugh in class, making my parents laugh. And I loved making bullies laugh. Because when bullies were laughing, then they couldn’t punch me. I learned that making people laugh was a powerful tool for bringing people together.
How did the opportunity to work on The Daily Show come about?
That was a coincidence combined with luck and a lot of hard work. I was doing stand-up comedy in Africa for a very long time, and I would put my clips up on YouTube. One day, Jon Stewart [the previous host of The Daily Show] saw some of my clips and contacted me. He said, “I like your comedy, and I want you to come work at The Daily Show.” So I flew to America. One day, Stewart said he was leaving the show and needed a replacement. He said I should do it, the network agreed, and I became the host. It was like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.
Your memoir is going to be made into a movie. How do you feel about that?
I’m really excited. Lupita Nyong’o from Black Panther is going to be working on the movie. She’s an amazing actress. It will be exciting to see her playing my mom in the movie.
Who would you want to play Trevor Noah? 
That’s a good question. It will have to be somebody young. Hopefully, I can find someone in South Africa who reminds me of myself. Whoever it is, it’ll have to be someone who is as funny as I was when I was young, as cute as I was when I was young, and as naughty as I was when I was young.
